I countered this supposition and argued that it is a useful feature for certain applications. But I didn't want to leave the reader with the impression that I thought that there were no features that I would regard as design mistakes. That is certainly not the case. \n\nThe 8051 was an early design by Intel and was copied by many other manufacturers. It has features that are truly design mistakes that should never have happened. It is an architecture which should have been left to die an early death but was perpetuated by hardware people who are deficient in their software capabilities. \n\nOne of its design mistakes is its upward-growing stack. What this does is to reverse the order of the bytes so that they don't appear like they should in memory. They are useless as local variables. Advanced programming languages like C heavily use variables stored in the stack for active temporary storage. But because of the deficiency of the 8051's stack-relative address modes, it is a moot point. It is akin to a blind person finding himself without binoculars when they would be useful for identifying birds for example. \n\nThe Motorola HC08 has a downward-growing stack and it has good stack relative addressing modes. But even this architecture has a minor design mistake. It uses post-decrement instead of pre-decrement for pushes and pre-increment instead of post-increment for pulls. This flaw was corrected in the HC12. But Motorola decided to keep the flaw in the HC08 to maintain software compatibility. All-in-all, the HC08 is still far superior to the 8051. \n\nThe x86 got it right when it comes to push and pull stack operations. Intel just used the wrong key word for \"pull\". RISC-V doesn't have built-in push and pull operations. It is a raw primitive architecture like IBM's mainframes. \n\n#Intel8051 #ISA #assembly #programming #computers #microcontrollers",

CPUs, GPUs, and whatever other PUs are out today have an advantage over FPGA-based computers: They can change their behavior by fetching and executing instructions. PUs can get instructions in microseconds, while FPGAs take three to four orders of magnitude longer to change their behavior. If FPGAs could change their behavior in microseconds, they would be a contender for the best PU.\n\nMy solution is to use an advanced microcoded runtime loadable finite state machine to control the FPGA logic. You can load the microcode at any time in microseconds to change the hardware's behavior. This is the hardest problem to be tackled in FPGA-based computer systems. \n\nIt won't matter if the hardware runs 10x faster if you only accelerate 50% of the algorithm's performance. People are working on the wrong problem. A good question is, \"How much of the software can I pack into the hardware?\" because that will make a difference. \n\nI call my system NoISA computing.

        "summary": "Paul McKneely\n        \n              \n          RISC processors are easier to design, cheaper to make and run at lower power than CISC processors. It is because you get less for your money. A Volkswagen Beetle is cheaper than a Mercedes Benz for the same reasons. Design shortcuts can come at a high price, resulting in loss of greater functionality down the road. An example in programming language design is that references to arrays in C degenerate to pointers when passed as arguments to functions. This mistake in C's design relegated it to an obligate scalar programming language. \u03d5PPL did not go this route. Instead, syntax of arrays obeys the same general set of rules that apply to scalars. \n\nA shortcut taken in the design of RISC processors is that tests and branches are included in the same instructions. There is only one positive for doing this and that is that an instruction is eliminated in some usage cases. But there are many negatives for having instructions like this. One is that you must perform redundant tests for situations where there are more than two outcomes. An example is when a result is greater, less than or equal. There are also \"defined\" vs \"undefined\" and \"carry/overflow/infinity\" vs \"no carry/no overflow/finite\". A RISC processor sees no savings in doing the same test over and over again that also involves repeated inclusion of the same opcodes and register references. \n\nAnother thing that is sacrificed when combining tests with branches is that their instructions can never be used for doing vector operations. They are inherently scalar-only operations. RISC processors must resort to looping through the elements of an array to handle them individually. That is not vector processing. So RISC processors have to invent a whole new system for vectors. This includes such things as predicates which are much less versatile than flags.\u00a0This strategy does not benefit from the scalar instructions already present. \n\nCISC processors separate tests and branches into separate instructions. The purpose of flags is to capture the results of tests so that branch instructions can link up with them. Flags are ideal for use in multi-way branches like the example I gave above. Removing branches from test operations gives you a path for branchless processing which is required for efficient vector processing. Flags can impose inter-dependencies on instructions. They can stall pipelines and super-scalar processors. \u03d5Engine processors have four flag sets which removes this bottle neck. Vector Flag Sets provide one scalar flag set per vector element. There are four of these that can be used for local storage when not needed for vector operation. \n\n\u03d5SemiVec finds the sweet spot between register context size and branchless operation. It maximizes the throughput of the processor and memory bus using the same instruction set for both scalar and vector operations. No other processor ISA does this. \n\n#computers #electronics #programming #ISA #assembly",

We identify and compute new radiative corrections arising from virtual pions that were missed in previous studies. The largest correction is a percent-level shift in the axial charge of the nucleon proportional to the electromagnetic part of the pion-mass splitting. Smaller corrections, comparable to anticipated experimental precision, impact the\u00a0\u03b2-\u03bd\u00a0angular correlations and the\u00a0\u03b2-asymmetry. We comment on implications of our results for the comparison of the experimentally measured axial charge with first-principle computations using lattice QCD and on the potential of\u00a0\u03b2-decay experiments to constrain beyond-the-Standard-Model interactions.\n\n#computing #quantumcomputing #semiconductors #compositivelogic #Innovation #Technology #China #Entrepreneurship #management #startups #future #India #Singapore #science #quantumtech #quantumtechnology #hydrogen #physics #mathematics #quantummechanics\nhttps://lnkd.in/ehY8ZYpC",

Entanglement, a fundamental quantum phenomenon, can be leveraged to connect and influence these time-encoded states.\n\n**Entanglement in the Context of TSPD**\n\n1. **Entangling TSPD1 with Past Elements:**\n   * **Quantum Memory:** To preserve past quantum states for entanglement, a quantum memory or register is required. This could be implemented using techniques like quantum error correction.\n   * **Entanglement Operation:** A quantum gate, such as a controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate, can be applied to entangle TSPD1 with a past quantum state stored in the memory.\n\n2. **Redirecting Entanglement Values to TESP1:**\n   * **Measurement:** Measuring the entangled past quantum state can collapse its wavefunction, influencing the state of TESP1.\n   * **Conditional Operations:** Based on the measurement outcome, conditional quantum operations can be applied to TESP1 to update its state and continue the time sequence.\n\n**Implications and Potential Applications:**\n\n* **Quantum Timekeeping:** Entanglement could provide a mechanism to link different time-encoded states, allowing for more complex temporal relationships and potentially improving the accuracy and stability of quantum clocks.\n* **Quantum Information Processing:** Entangled TSPD states could be used as a resource for quantum information processing tasks, such as quantum algorithms and simulations.\n* **Quantum Communication:** Entanglement can enable secure quantum communication protocols, where the security relies on the principles of quantum mechanics.\n\n**Challenges and Considerations:**\n\n* **Decoherence:** Maintaining entanglement over time is challenging due to decoherence. Quantum error correction techniques are essential to mitigate this issue.\n* **Scalability:** Implementing entanglement-based TSPD systems at a large scale can be technically demanding.\n* **Algorithm Development:** Designing efficient quantum algorithms that leverage entanglement for time-related tasks requires careful consideration.\n\nIn conclusion, TSPD and entanglement offer a promising approach to representing and manipulating time in the quantum realm. By understanding and addressing the challenges associated with these concepts, researchers can explore new possibilities for quantum computing and timekeeping.",
