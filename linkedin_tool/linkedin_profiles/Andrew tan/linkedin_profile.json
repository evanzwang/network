He worked under me at Branch Metrics as an intern during the summer of 2015 between graduating high school and starting at Berkeley. From the moment he interviewed, I could tell he would be an incredibly valuable addition to our team. For example, when asked what our company does and how the tech works, Andrew gave one of the top 5 answers I've ever heard anyone give - out of 500+ interviews, most of which were seasoned veterans in the space. As an 18 year old, to be able to understand our technology before he even interviewed is an incredible feat. He is incredibly sharp, but also really kind and hard working. Anyone would be lucky to have him on their team. \u201d"
