        "summary": "Prakhar Sinha\n        \n              \n          A few short days ago, I wrapped up my research position at UC Davis Health with Professor Farzad Fereidouni. My role at the lab entailed a specialization in machine learning and computer vision and I'm excited to share what I was able to accomplish with everyone. \n\nI worked on two projects during my time at the lab. The first one was something I called \"Kernel Generation for Image Similarity\" (https://lnkd.in/ghsY73ts). It was to process an image such that it would look like it was H&E stained. I learned a lot about the basics of histology and digital histology through this process. The most novel part of this approach was using Wiener deconvolution to generate a kernel that would be used to enhance image similarity (typically using SSIM, MSE or a combination of both). \n\nA big part of this process was optimization. I learned how to use Python libraries such as Cupy and other tools to GPU accelerate a lot of these image-processing optimization problems.\n\nMy second project and my most meaningful contribution was called \"FastSAM-needle-biopsy\" (https://lnkd.in/gXXydq-X). The objective of this project was to use the FastSAM image segmentation network to accurately generate image segmentation masks of live tissue such that a microscope would only scan the relevant parts of an image. Here is step by step walkthrough of the image processing pipeline:\n\n1) VB.NET (Darius) application calls a DLL (compiled from csharp.NET)\n2) DLL calls FastSAM image segmentation code using Python.NET\n3) FastSAM segments image and returns image segmentation bitmask and as well as the fastest path to visit every bit (Traveling Salesman Problem)\n4) Python returns values are returned to DLL using JSON as a reliable data transfer solution\u00a0\n5) DLL returns an object that can be parsed by VB.NET\n\nFastSAM is a faster version of Meta Research's Segment Anything Model and I used it to greatly speed up development time on this project. It was a big challenge to integrate such cutting-edge, machine-learning driven, image processing pipelines into a legacy codebase that was written in Visual Basic .NET but thanks to tools such as DLLs, JSON, and C#, I was able to figure it out!\n\nI am very grateful for the time I spent in the lab. I feel like I developed some great programming skills, especially in computer vision, that will prove useful for the rest of my career. I'd like to give special thanks to Professor Fereidouni, Ruby Mascareno, Willy Ju, Dena Sayrafi, Ruben Gnanaruban, Inyola, Antara Mallick, and Jayla. \n\nThe link is here if you'd like to see my lab report going over everything I did in more technical detail and with a few pictures!\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/gRpZVmjG\n\n#computervision #machinelearning #AI #histology",

Working with Aaditya Pore, Rami Maalouf, and Ethan Jagoda, we created Text to Dot.\n\nText to dot is a tool that attempts to help those who are visually impaired convert physical texts into tactile braille for ease of access. The inspiration for this project came from our research into current text-to-braille systems, which were very clunky and expensive, making them relatively inaccessible to the general public. As such, we sought to create a convenient, straightforward, and economically efficient gadget that visually impaired individuals could utilize to access different forms of information. Our team hopes to spark positive change within the realm of assistive technology, and we hope to make a long-lasting impact on those who can use our products. \n\nUsing Deepgram, Cartesia, Groq, Hyperbolic, and Vapi, we were able to create a scanner that could take images of text and output a comprehensive written transcript. This transcript would then be passed on to one of three separate implementations, a text-to-braille, text-to-speech, and speech-to-speech model, which allowed users to choose how they wanted to experience information. This software was then combined with a complex hardware component that was made up of a 3D housing, Microcontrollers, Solenoids, and Camera Sensors to make up our final product. \n\nOur project didn't come without its challenges. From difficulties with 3D printing, troubles scanning text, and even a burnt out microcontroller, we were constantly pushed to our limits. However, at the end of the day, we created an impactful product all while improving our technical skills and having an amazing time. Winning the Voice Agent Quest Prize for our utilization of Deepgram's AI TTS technology was the perfect end to an incredible hackathon \ud83c\udfc6 .\n\nPlease take a look at our project: https://lnkd.in/gC3kxH-D\n\nA special thanks to all of the hackers who were willing to lend us their spare hardware, the Deepgram team for recognizing our project, and Raghav Lamsal  for showing me around campus and giving me food and housing whenever I wasn't at the hackathon.\n\nCal Hacks 11.0 was such a wonderful experience, giving me countless opportunities to meet new people and learn new things, and I'm excited to attend more hackathons in the future.",

As the buzz of Telegraph Avenue dims slightly, we undergrads know it\u2019s our cue to hunker down and hit the books one last time before finals. Here are some key points I've been focusing on as we wrap up this dead week!\n\nLesson 1: Structure in Chaos\nBerkeley\u2019s Dead Week is ironically alive with a flurry of review sessions and last-minute project deadlines. I've found that a structured approach\u2014breaking down study sessions into focused blocks\u2014helps me navigate this intense week. The serene backdrop of the Bay Area, from the calming waters by the marina to the redwoods around campus, provides the perfect study break scenery to clear my mind and reset.\n\nLesson 2: The Strength of Shared Struggles\nThere's something about the communal silence of Mainstacks Library during Dead Week that reminds you you're not alone. Joining forces with other students, we grind out practice exams and Pomodoro sessions until 2 am. It's these moments of collaboration that transform challenging content into shared victories.\n\nLesson 3: Well-being as a Priority\nDead Week at Berkeley is not just about academic survival but also about maintaining well-being amidst the madness. I make it a point to keep up with my runs through the Fire Trails, ensuring that my mental and physical health aren\u2019t sidelined during these critical times.\n\nLesson 4: Reflection and Readiness\nAs I review notes and practice problems, I\u2019m also reflecting on how each semester builds more than just technical skills. It hones resilience, deepens patience, and expands my understanding of what I can achieve under pressure.\n\nWith finals on the horizon, I feel prepared and eager to tackle the challenges ahead. To my peers also in the midst of Dead Week, let\u2019s push through to the finish line with determination and spirit! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nWhat are your Dead Week strategies?

The last 2 years have been an incredible learning experience for me. I had the opportunity to delve into applied research while working on some amazing projects with some fantastic mentors and peers.\n\nI began my residency working on Horizon world understanding and asset understanding. I worked on developing image collection algorithms from VR and on vision modules training & recommendation problems. My first prod-release was the \"For your world\" section on the Horizon App (recommending similar assets for creators in VR worlds).\nAfter a reorg to GenAI in February of last year, I had the chance to work on AI characters. It was my first pure NLP project, coming from a vision/audio background. I was fortunate enough to witness the development of the project from a very ambiguous idea to a fully matured product. I worked on collecting open-source conversation datasets, experimenting with prompt templates & llm-finetuning, automated evals & synthetic data for alignment, automated prompt tuning & finally witnessed the launch at Meta-Connect last year (saw Zuck in person and got a picture clicked with him). After Meta-Connect, I worked on building models for prompt-suggestion & modeling human behavior in user-ai conversations. During the same time, I got a chance to work a bit on the AI creation side, and on alignment for avoid-topics. Finally, towards the end, I got the chance to witness the launch of full-fledged AI Studio.\nI had the privilege of working in one of the most fast-paced environments. I truly experienced the \"Move Fast, break things\" mantra. I had the opportunity to work in highly ambiguous scenarios with changing priorities and to come up with more directed goals. I got to explore applied research, plan projects from scratch, and work on some really cool ideas. I made many mistakes, learned tons of new things, met some really awesome people, and got to work on some really interesting projects.\n\nBig thanks to Yashar for bringing me to the team, being my continuous support for first 1.5 years, regular 1-1, continuously checking on me, invaluable career discussions & advice, getting me chance to work on some really cool projects & providing continuous support throughout first 1.5 years.\n\nThanks to my mentors/peers Aasish, Asish, Bo, Anchit, and many more I couldn't list here for continuous support throughout 2 years, numerous valuable feedbacks, helping me set directions over ambiguous & ambitious goals and numerous advices to help me grow in my career.\n\nThanks to Dhruv [Trust me he\u2019s real life Sheldon Cooper] for being an awesome friend, good roommate, being with me on highs & lows, taking mock interviews & bear with me for all the craps I talk about. \n\nWhat\u2019s next?

We had vaguely heard about YC from a friend who had just gotten accepted but had no plans of applying whatsoever.\n\nHowever when the YC deadline rolled around, we spontaneously decided to put in an application on the very last day. We spent that whole day in Karun\u2019s dorm room typing up the application and filming all the required videos. We finally hit submit the minute of the deadline!\n\nBy the next day we had already moved on. We went back to the usual rhythm of coding in the dorm room, calling with doctors, attending conferences, etc. If anything, we were even more motivated now to get more traction and be successful regardless.\n\nLater that week, while we were eating in the dorm kitchen, I noticed I got an email saying we had a YC interview scheduled. My heart rate spiked. I jumped up out of my seat and immediately told Karun. I never seriously considered YC, but for the first time it hit me that it might actually be a possibility.\n\nWhen the day of the interview rolled around, we did mock interviews with former YC founders and focused mostly on calming our nerves. More important than the actual content of the interview, we wanted to show our excitement for building and hacking together as co-founders.\n\nUnfortunately the interview caught us by surprise. The group partners didn't seem to care as much about our actual AI medical scribe. Instead, they seemed more curious about a side idea we had listed in our application that we wrote up in a day. The idea was about streamlining HIPAA compliance (since we had to go through HIPAA for our AI medical scribe).\n\nBy this point, we were already seriously considering pivoting into this and had made a lot of progress on the idea. The YC interview was our tipping point\n\nNot too long after, we got an ominous email titled \u201cYC.\u201d We were freaked out. I could not sleep the entire night. Then, in the middle of class the next day, I got a phone call from Karun with Surbhi on the other end of the line. My heart rate spiked. I ran outside of the classroom.\n\nThat turned out to be our acceptance call:)\n\n--\n\nFor everyone out there still waiting to hear back, just keep grinding. Build as if you\u2019ve been rejected and you might just be pleasantly surprised.\n\nI\u2019m also always here to help with mock interviews/give advice! We\u2019ve helped a handful of friends through the YC app process and are always here to support other founders!",

One startup in Korea \u2014 QANDA(Mathpresso) \u2014 has built its own math-specific LLM that can outperform many of the incumbents.\n\nIf you are building AI to promote math learning and understanding, please reach out!\n\nVery grateful for the opportunity to go deeper in the EdTech space at Reach Capital this summer before kicking off my MBA/MA in Education at Stanford in the fall! Shoutout to Tony Wan and James Kim for the support on this piece!\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/g8xk_hqJ",

He has enormous passion in software engineering and solving challenging problems. I have firsthand knowledge of his exceptional work ethic, remarkable communication skills, and outstanding technical abilities. In our work, Ryan was mainly responsible for mining defect datasets from online repositories of bugs. He also used static analysis tools (i.e., Spoon) to better analyze large amounts of code data and instrument datasets for better training of large language models. I would highly recommend Ryan for future internships.\u201d"

His research focused on health disparities in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) prediction using machine learning (ML). I was impressed by Ryan's ability to accomplish so much in such short span of time as a high school intern. From data access and cohort extraction using GCP and BigQuery, to training ML models such as Random Forest and XGBoost, and interpreting model outputs using statistical methods and SHAP, he showcased exceptional talent. Ryan won the Jessica Lynn Saul Fellowship Award from the Stanford Institutes of Medicine Summer Research Program (SIMR), one of the top 3 out of 54 SIMR participants.\u201d"
