This pioneering standard lays the groundwork for advancements in tele-surgery, tele-driving, and immersive gaming experiences.\n\nHaptic codecs, much like JPEG for images and MP3 for audio, enable the efficient transmission of tactile information over the Internet. The new IEEE standard 1918.1.1 encodes and decodes data to allow users to experience remote tactile interactions, such as feeling the grip of a robot arm or the texture of materials like paper or metal.\n\nProf. Eckehard Steinbach, leading the research at TUM, highlighted the challenge of transmitting haptic feedback, which requires bidirectional data flow and ultra-low latency to maintain realistic interactions. The new standard reduces the clock rate from 4,000 to 100 times per second, aligning closely with human perception thresholds.\n\nThe applications of HCTI are vast:\n\n\u2695\ufe0f Telesurgery: Enables surgeons to perform operations remotely with precision, even across long distances.\n\n\ud83d\ude9a Teledriving: Facilitates remote control of vehicles, enhancing safety and flexibility in autonomous driving.\n\n\ud83d\udc89 Emergency Medical Services: Allows remote ultrasound diagnostics by doctors while en route to hospitals.\n\n\ud83c\udfa6 Entertainment: Enhances realism in gaming and films by transmitting physical sensations.\n\n\ud83d\udcbb E-commerce: Provides tactile feedback for online shoppers, enhancing the shopping experience.\n\nThis new standard is expected to spur innovation and new applications, much like JPEG and MP3 did for their respective fields.\n\nFor more details, visit TUM's official website -https://lnkd.in/eDfvSz_x\n\nTo access the standard, visit IEEE here - https://lnkd.in/eenTQAaH",

Our approach does not rely on prior information about the physical system, which allows the RL agent to explore a broader range of pulse sequences. The results showed that the RL-optimized pulses not only surpassed standard cross-resonance gates in fidelity but also reduced gate duration, while maintaining robustness against stochastic noise.\n\nThese findings highlight the potential of RL-based optimization methods to enhance quantum gate design, contributing to the development of more efficient and scalable quantum computing systems.\n\n\ud83d\udcda For more information, please read the full paper here: https://lnkd.in/eMc97S8i\n \nAuthors: Ho Nam Nguyen, Felix Motzoi, Mekena Metcalf, K.
