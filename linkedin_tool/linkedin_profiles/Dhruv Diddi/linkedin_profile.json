He was hired as an instructor about half way through my cohorts time at General Assembly. Dhruv brought with him experience and extensive knowledge in the software engineering field. He also quickly became one of everyones favorite instructors to go to because of his easy going and patient nature. He is a a great teacher who doesn't get frustrated when students are having a hard time understanding, and is knowledgable enough on topics to be able to break concepts down differently to help each student learn. Anyone who has the opportunity to work with Dhruv in any capacity is very lucky to have him as a part of their team.\u201d"
