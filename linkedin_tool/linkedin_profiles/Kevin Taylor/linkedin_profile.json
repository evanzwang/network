They're not just slapping AI onto existing teaching methods; they're reimagining education entirely.\n\nHuman-AI Teamwork:\u00a0While AI assistants will play a key role, teachers will still be the driving force behind course design and instruction. Think of it as a dynamic duo, working together to create the ultimate learning experience.\n\nFirst Product: An AI Course!\u00a0Before unleashing full-fledged AI assistants, Eureka Labs is launching\u00a0LLM101n, an undergraduate-level course teaching students how to build their own AI. Talk about learning by doing!\n\nMysterious Future:\u00a0While the AI assistant vision is exciting, Eureka Labs is keeping things pretty hush-hush about the specifics. Will these assistants be based on real people? Will they be integrated into traditional classrooms or online platforms? Only time will tell.\n\nThe Big Questions:\n\nFunding:\u00a0Is Karpathy bootstrapping this venture, or has he secured backing from investors?\n\nTimeline:\u00a0When can we expect to see these AI assistants in action?\n\nBusiness Model:\u00a0How will Eureka Labs make money?\n\nStay tuned, folks! This is a story we'll definitely be keeping our eyes on.\nKarpathy's got a track record of pushing the boundaries of AI, and we can't wait to see what he cooks up in the world of education.\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/ecR56Vke",
