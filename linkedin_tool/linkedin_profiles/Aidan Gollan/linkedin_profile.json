This score marks the average human performance\n\n\u25aa\ufe0f Concerns over AI research concentration: \n\nCollet claims that corporations like OpenAI have monopolized AI research and hindered open innovation by restricting access to their latest findings. This centralization is believed to slow down broader AI progress for several years.\n\n\u25aa\ufe0f Future of AI development:\n\nFor AI to achieve human-like general intelligence, models need to go beyond mere data interpolation. This includes development of methods for discrete program synthesis and search that can generalize across diverse tasks with minimal data.\n\nHere's the full video of the conversation.

More than half of humanoids will be sold to consumers\n\n- The 'killer apps' will be speech and vision\n- Traditional SLAs for business customers will force robotics teams away from building good generalist models\n- \"Robotics companies will start looking more like SV tech companies, caring about user engagement and retention.\"\n\nQuestion: What are the 'killer' consumer use cases that will drive this adoption?
