On the flip side, too many epochs can lead to overfitting, where the model learns the noise in the training data and performs poorly on unseen data.\u00a0 \n\nHow do we find the right balance?\u00a0 \n\n- Validation data : \nUse a separate dataset to monitor performance during training.

As their role in decision-making grows, it's crucial to ensure they align with diverse human preferences to promote fairness and sound economic decisions.\nHowever, human preferences vary widely due to cultural backgrounds and personal experiences, often leading LLMs to exhibit biases favoring dominant viewpoints. Traditional methods for aligning LLMs with human preferences often suffer from algorithmic bias and preference collapse.\nEnter Preference Matching RLHF, a revolutionary approach that effectively mitigates algorithmic bias while aligning LLMs with diverse human preferences. This method employs a preference-matching regularizer, derived by solving an ordinary differential equation, to balance response diversification and reward maximization.\n\ud83e\uddea Experimental validation on OPT-1.3B and Llama-2-7B models shows a 29% to 41% improvement in capturing diverse human preferences compared to standard RLHF methods. These results underscore the potential of Preference Matching RLHF to enhance fairness and efficiency in AI decision-making processes.\nLet's embrace this innovative approach to make AI more inclusive and equitable! \ud83d\udca1\ud83e\udd16 #AI #MachineLearning #Innovation #Fairness #TechForGood\nhttps://lnkd.in/emPuUBWH",

Dan Becker and Hamel H. put together a group of LLM experts, with very interesting and impactful lectures. There was a LOT of content so I'll still be working through all the lectures for a while. Some of my favourite parts include:\n- The hands-on workshop on fine-tuning a base model. The Axolotl configs make this so much easier and accessible \n- The insight around the iterative process of why and when you'd want to fine-tune and LLM rather than tweak user and system prompts, setting up a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) pipeline or training a new base model.\n- The strong focus on being diligent about evaluation with the aim of measuring the accuracy and improvement of your LLM.\n- Shreya Shankar's work on 'scaling up the vibe checks' and developing evaluation frameworks that can measure quality and progress of your LLM; LLMs have the challenge that they output text, rather than numbers, so it's not as simple as making the RMSE number go down. \n- Jonathan Whitaker's napkin math lecture on how to figure out how much GPU firepower is needed to fine-tune base models of different sizes with different LoRA/qLoRA configurations.\n\nDespite the technical depth, there was a clear focus on building practical AI applications that are purpose-driven and solve problems.",

Unlocking New Frontiers in Protein Structure Prediction \ud83e\uddec\nAfter six months of anticipation, Google DeepMind has officially released AlphaFold3\u2019s software code, making it available for non-commercial use. This breakthrough comes as John Jumper, AlphaFold\u2019s lead, and Demis Hassabis recently won a Nobel Prize for their pioneering work.\nSo, what\u2019s new with AlphaFold3?\nUnlike AlphaFold2, AlphaFold3 can model proteins in combination with other molecules. This powerful upgrade is set to transform drug discovery, as researchers can now simulate protein interactions with drug candidates\u2014a feature previously limited by server access.\nThe Path to Openness\nDespite initially withholding the code to balance accessibility with commercial interests, DeepMind\u2019s decision to release the model paves the way for academic advancements. While some parameters, such as training weights, remain restricted to academic requests, this release is a huge win for scientific reproducibility and collaborative research.\nBut DeepMind\u2019s Not Alone\u2026\nAs DeepMind launches AlphaFold3, other companies have jumped on the protein-prediction scene. ByteDance, Baidu, and San Francisco\u2019s Chai Discovery have each launched their own versions, with Ligo Biosciences offering a restriction-free model and OpenFold3 soon to follow.\nWhy It Matters\nThis open-access move is more than just a release; it\u2019s about fostering a culture of scientific transparency. As Anthony Gitter from the University of Wisconsin-Madison puts it, \"Open science requires that when claims are made, others can inspect the tools.\"\nThis is just the beginning. With AlphaFold3 now accessible, the scientific community is set to take protein structure predictions to a whole new level. \ud83c\udf10\ud83d\udca1\n#AlphaFold3 #DeepMind #OpenScience #DrugDiscovery #AIinBiology #NobelPrize \n\nsource: https://lnkd.in/dA9XDr74",
