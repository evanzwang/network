        "summary": "James Dancer\n        \n              \n          We're seeing a move beyond LLMs and Generative AI. OpenAI and Microsoft and others have built great models, operating right at the frontier of the compute and transformer architectures presently available. Software coding and natural language interfaces will never be the same again. Equally, we've seen phenomenally smart models from groups like Google DeepMind, some of which will have impact on how science itself is carried out.\n\nBut LLMs and non-expert models are the wrong tool for applied AI at scale. The competition is now for better, high-quality data, relevant for expert niches in domains from materials and engineering to pharma and health. That data is often proprietary, hard to access and sometimes highly regulated. You can't scrape it from the internet, and it's not just 'content' you can license - data on patients, molecules, and engine performance are much more tightly held than Getty Images or articles from the Financial Times.\n\nAs important as the data, every group building applied AI will need experts in those domains - clinicians, biologists, engineers - who have been additionally trained in AI and computer science. The brief era of generalist computer science folk doing work in expert domains is fast closing. Teams have to understand what data is important, how to collect it, what it means, and how to exploit it operationally, and an ontology and infrastructure to match. And then those teams will need to do the difficult job of turning models into functional products, which lead to concrete real world outcomes, in domains which are hard to change. All of that is a heck of a lot harder than building a big model and adding a user interface, however complex the underlying computer science. \n\nThe shift is now to synthetic rather than generative AI. That work will be centred in research institutions like the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, The Francis Crick Institute or the University of Oxford - where I advise folk doing work along these lines. It will require close partnerships with global corporations and institutions, from Novo Nordisk to Rolls-Royce, and with hyper scale tech groups like Amazon Web Services (AWS), as routes to both data and scale. And it will need global investors like DCVC, Sofinnova Partners, Sequoia Capital, 8VC and Index Ventures to help build the new wave of expert-led applied AI ventures.\n\nThere's more to come on this from places like Oxford and global investors. We see and strongly support others moving in the same direction, across the US, Europe and close allies. (And we should all move beyond the dated 'US vs Europe' narrative - there is really just one, connected capital and talent pool for this work. The work is too important to make it a transatlantic competition.)",

Hoyss on Shaping the Future of Nothing OS | https://lnkd.in/eFyYx9n6\n\nGetting the chance to talk with Mladen was a surreal opportunity, and I\u2019m truly grateful to the Nothing community for choosing me to be their voice. It\u2019s moments like these that bring my journey full circle.\n\nMy history with Mladen\u2019s work goes back to the early days of Blloc. While I couldn\u2019t use the Zero18 phone, I\u2019ve been following Blloc since the beginning. I got into the closed beta testing of Ratio, their minimalist launcher. At that time, I was heavily addicted to my smartphone. Ratio had a profound impact on my usage habits, significantly reducing my screen time. I was so impressed that I continued using it across three to four different phones, often proudly sharing screenshots of my reduced screen time on social media.\n\nWhen I heard about Mladen M Hoyss joining Nothing I thought, \u201cThis is a collaboration that was bound to happen.\u201d The transition from Ratio to Nothing OS has been an evolution in my smartphone experience. It\u2019s fascinating to see how Mladen\u2019s philosophy has been integrated into a more comprehensive and fun environment at Nothing while still maintaining the core principles of mindful technology use.\n\nThis interview has not only provided insights into Nothing\u2019s design philosophy, but also allowed me to connect the dots in my personal journey with mindful technology use. I\u2019m excited to see how Nothing continues to evolve and grateful for the opportunity to be part of this community-driven conversation about the future of technology.\n\n#NothingCommunity #NothingOS",

The Oligopoly That is Blowing Billions on AI \n\n- Microsoft, Azure, & Google now represent $7T market cap.\n- Of course they will spend billions to protect their oligopoly\n- What is most interesting is Meta is the only incumbent that is financing this not with cloud being their cash cow.\n\n2. How Startups Could Win with the Cost of Compute Coming Down\n\n- Big tech companies are producers of compute & startups are consumers of compute.\n- Overproduction of compute = lower prices.\u00a0\n- This gives startups higher margins & makes them more valuable. \n\n3. Is Compute the Currency of the Future or Do the Costs Come Down and It Is Commoditised?\n\n- We are forgetting \u201ccompute\u201d is a euphemism for a $2BN data center in the middle of nowhere.\n- They have GPUs & liquid cooling systems that need to be constantly optimized & upgraded.\n- We cannot simply build 15 years worth of compute all at once. \u200aNo one's ever going to train a frontier model on the same data center twice.\n\n4. Data Centre Teams and Model Teams Need to Be Coupled\n\n- You cannot have separate teams running data centers & building models.\n- Elon & Zuck control all their data centres.\n- It will not work as these models get better & better.\n\n5. Why the Data Center Is the Most Important Asset\n\n- There is not much difference between these models today.\n- AI researchers are jumping from one lab to another.\n- Scaling laws will become more dominant as these models get bigger.\n\n6. Servers Steel and Power: The Three Bottlenecks of AI\n\nThree things:\n1. Servers: NVIDIA, AMD, Broadcom\u2026\n2. Steel: Construction & real estate developers for data centers.\n3. Power: All the energy required for AI.\n- More factories will be built in 12 months for AI and we will see another industrial revolution.\n\n7. You Have to Have a Cash Machine to Play the Big Model Game\n\n- Amazon has AWS\n- Meta has Instagram\n- Microsoft has Azure\n- You need a cash machine to compete and it CANNOT be the AI business.\n\n8.

It made me wanna make this video to explain my own journey as a former Data Scientist trained by MIT/UCL, who quit the career I used to dream of and became a self-taught full-stack founder. This means there is no established database ready for me to query from and build models, but everything starts from speaking to users, designing a user experience flow, prototyping a functional full-stack app, and launching it to the market. It wasn't an easy journey, but I got so much motivation to do this after thinking and debating very hard about the career of being a data scientist.

My path here was somewhat circuitous in that I was going through Y Combinator's Summer 24 cohort which had a plethora of AI use cases that were very industry specific. I found that curious in that earlier SaaS offerings should have already automated and/or digitized most of these process, and I couldn't figure out why AI startups would focus on basic workflows such as inventory management and book keeping. As I dove into the matter, with the help of my now indispensable Perplexity, I landed on a very insightful post by Bessemer Venture Partners (https://lnkd.in/gHtQQRha). The thesis is that Vertical AI  companies are going to be magnitudes bigger than general solutions, especially as they focus on industries that were earlier inaccessible to SaaS given very high language based workflows. Within that thesis, there was also a mention of AI Agents and how these would come to dominate workflow automation going forward. This neatly tied in with a great conversation between Peter H. Diamandis and Emad Mostaque (https://lnkd.in/g-ccxbma) that talked about 10 billion agents!! \n\nI have spent the last few weeks diving into AI Agents with the help of content from interesting voices such as Adam Silverman (Hiring) and David Ondrej. Over the next few months, I will try to create and deploy AI Agents on some basic use cases to get hands on experience on these systems. In the meantime, I will close this post with a link to a video from Andrew Ng, a pioneer in AI systems that provides a short overview of AI Agents (https://lnkd.in/g8v4pUQu). I hope you enjoy the content and wish everyone a productive week ahead.",

What's in your line of sight is what you know best.\n\n\u2022 Combine existing ideas in novel ways. Even small perturbations from status quo can generate large innovation leaps.\n\n\u2022 Stay curious about developments in adjacent industries. Cross-domain patterns create fresh sources of ideas, while also expanding the adjacent possible.\n\nMost of all, it takes the 'genius' pressure off the team.
