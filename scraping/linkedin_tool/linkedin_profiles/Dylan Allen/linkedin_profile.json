I love his can-do attitude and eagerness to learn to solve complex problems. It was a breeze teaching Dylan with fundamentals of frontend engineering, and he took off quickly and was working on tickets independently. Dylan is someone I would want to have as a permanent teammate, so that being said, any team looking for a well-rounded engineer who also has product management, do not miss out on him.\u201d"
