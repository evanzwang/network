My role at the lab entailed a specialization in machine learning and computer vision and I'm excited to share what I was able to accomplish with everyone. \n\nI worked on two projects during my time at the lab. The first one was something I called \"Kernel Generation for Image Similarity\" (https://lnkd.in/ghsY73ts). It was to process an image such that it would look like it was H&E stained. I learned a lot about the basics of histology and digital histology through this process. The most novel part of this approach was using Wiener deconvolution to generate a kernel that would be used to enhance image similarity (typically using SSIM, MSE or a combination of both). \n\nA big part of this process was optimization. I learned how to use Python libraries such as Cupy and other tools to GPU accelerate a lot of these image-processing optimization problems.\n\nMy second project and my most meaningful contribution was called \"FastSAM-needle-biopsy\" (https://lnkd.in/gXXydq-X). The objective of this project was to use the FastSAM image segmentation network to accurately generate image segmentation masks of live tissue such that a microscope would only scan the relevant parts of an image. Here is step by step walkthrough of the image processing pipeline:\n\n1) VB.NET (Darius) application calls a DLL (compiled from csharp.NET)\n2) DLL calls FastSAM image segmentation code using Python.NET\n3) FastSAM segments image and returns image segmentation bitmask and as well as the fastest path to visit every bit (Traveling Salesman Problem)\n4) Python returns values are returned to DLL using JSON as a reliable data transfer solution\u00a0\n5) DLL returns an object that can be parsed by VB.NET\n\nFastSAM is a faster version of Meta Research's Segment Anything Model and I used it to greatly speed up development time on this project. It was a big challenge to integrate such cutting-edge, machine-learning driven, image processing pipelines into a legacy codebase that was written in Visual Basic .NET but thanks to tools such as DLLs, JSON, and C#, I was able to figure it out!\n\nI am very grateful for the time I spent in the lab. I feel like I developed some great programming skills, especially in computer vision, that will prove useful for the rest of my career. I'd like to give special thanks to Professor Fereidouni, Ruby Mascareno, Willy Ju, Dena Sayrafi, Ruben Gnanaruban, Inyola, Antara Mallick, and Jayla. \n\nThe link is here if you'd like to see my lab report going over everything I did in more technical detail and with a few pictures!\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/gRpZVmjG\n\n#computervision #machinelearning #AI #histology",

I just joined the first MIT research group which came my way.\n\nThis led to a miserable first 2 years of PhD for me. \n\nThe group was not a good fit and the research topic was also not a good fit.\n\nThese lost 2 years were a result of choosing what society values more (university ranking) rather than what is a better thing for me.\n\nWhen I look back, I should have done the following:\n\n(1) I should have made a list of all research groups I was interested in, from all universities I was selected to.\n\n(2) I should have spoken with the lab advisor from all these research groups and understood their vision.\n\n(3) I should have learnt more about the group culture by talking to past members of the group. Graduating members are usually very honest. They would tell you if the culture is toxic, if the advisor is micromanaging etc.\n\n(4) I should have looked at the group website to look at the publication rate, what do the alumni end up doing etc? If the average graduation time is 8 years, it\u2019s a red flag.\n\nAfter doing the above 4 things, I should have selected the best research group for me.\n\nI should have selected the research group whose culture aligns well with my personality.\n\nSociety values ranking. \n\nHowever, when you enter the university for a PhD, the ranking does not matter. Your research group matters. What you do every day after waking up matters.\n\nAnd if you blindly select universities based on the ranking, the research group won\u2019t be a good fit and it would lead to a terrible PhD experience.\n\nIt turns out that society misguides people in many other professions including:\n\n- Choosing to prepare for IIT-JEE just because society prefers that you are an IITian\n- Choosing a job just because society prefers higher salary\n- Choosing to not do a startup because the society (your parents) don\u2019t approve\n\nAlways question yourself before blindly making decisions based on what the society values. It might not be the best thing for you.\n\nGoing against traditional societal values is hard in the short term, but it pays off in the long run.\n\nP.S: In the photo, you can see me during my first day at MIT!",

Their primary concern: that systems incapable of empathy are being integrated into an already dysfunctional sector without much thought toward patient care: \"No computer, no AI can replace a human touch,\" said Amy Grewal, a registered nurse. \"It cannot hold your loved one's hand. You cannot teach a computer how to have empathy.\"\n\nThere are certainly roles automation can play in easing strain on a sector full of burnout after COVID, particularly when it comes to administrative tasks. The concern, as with other industries dominated by executives with poor judgement, is that this is being used as a justification by for-profit hospital systems to cut corners further. From a National Nurses United blog post (spotted by 404 Media): \"Nurses are not against scientific or technological advancement, but we will not accept algorithms replacing the expertise, experience, holistic, and hands-on approach we bring to patient care,\" they added.\n\nKaiser Permanente, for its part, insists it's simply leveraging \"state-of-the-art tools and technologies that support our mission of providing high-quality, affordable health care to best meet our members' and patients' needs.\" The company claims its \"Advance Alert\" AI monitoring system -- which algorithmically analyzes patient data every hour -- has the potential to save upwards of 500 lives a year. The problem is that healthcare giants' primary obligation no longer appears to reside with patients, but with their financial results. And, that's even true in non-profit healthcare providers. That is seen in the form of cut corners, worse service, and an assault on already over-taxed labor via lower pay and higher workload (curiously, it never seems to impact outsized high-level executive compensation).\n\nRead more of this story at Slashdot.",

We had vaguely heard about YC from a friend who had just gotten accepted but had no plans of applying whatsoever.\n\nHowever when the YC deadline rolled around, we spontaneously decided to put in an application on the very last day. We spent that whole day in Karun\u2019s dorm room typing up the application and filming all the required videos. We finally hit submit the minute of the deadline!\n\nBy the next day we had already moved on. We went back to the usual rhythm of coding in the dorm room, calling with doctors, attending conferences, etc. If anything, we were even more motivated now to get more traction and be successful regardless.\n\nLater that week, while we were eating in the dorm kitchen, I noticed I got an email saying we had a YC interview scheduled. My heart rate spiked. I jumped up out of my seat and immediately told Karun. I never seriously considered YC, but for the first time it hit me that it might actually be a possibility.\n\nWhen the day of the interview rolled around, we did mock interviews with former YC founders and focused mostly on calming our nerves. More important than the actual content of the interview, we wanted to show our excitement for building and hacking together as co-founders.\n\nUnfortunately the interview caught us by surprise. The group partners didn't seem to care as much about our actual AI medical scribe. Instead, they seemed more curious about a side idea we had listed in our application that we wrote up in a day. The idea was about streamlining HIPAA compliance (since we had to go through HIPAA for our AI medical scribe).\n\nBy this point, we were already seriously considering pivoting into this and had made a lot of progress on the idea. The YC interview was our tipping point\n\nNot too long after, we got an ominous email titled \u201cYC.\u201d We were freaked out. I could not sleep the entire night. Then, in the middle of class the next day, I got a phone call from Karun with Surbhi on the other end of the line. My heart rate spiked. I ran outside of the classroom.\n\nThat turned out to be our acceptance call:)\n\n--\n\nFor everyone out there still waiting to hear back, just keep grinding. Build as if you\u2019ve been rejected and you might just be pleasantly surprised.\n\nI\u2019m also always here to help with mock interviews/give advice! We\u2019ve helped a handful of friends through the YC app process and are always here to support other founders!",

A study found that these AI tools consistently ranked resumes with disability-related credentials lower than those without, revealing a bias against disabled individuals. Researchers attempted to mitigate this bias by customizing the tool with specific instructions to avoid ableism, but the improvements were minimal for certain disabilities. The findings were presented at the 2024 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency. Jennifer Mankoff, a professor in the Allen School at UW, emphasizes the need for further research on AI biases and their impact on job seekers.

Spent my summer vacation building different stages of compilation. Honestly, it was challenging but super rewarding.(will be posting about in depth)\n\n2) Exploring Vision Transformers\nAs part of an academic project on diabetic retinopathy. I dived deep into these models and learned a lot about computer vision. \n\n3)Web Scrapers for Placement Forums\nBuilt a few web scrapers for scraping placement-related forums. Unfortunately, I lost the code because I forgot to push it to GitHub before formatting my laptop (tough lesson learned here).\n\n4)YouTube Watch Party App\nI\u2019ve been working on a YouTube Watch Party app to learn WebSockets and WebRTC. It\u2019s nearly finished\u2014just needs a few final touches and some code cleanup before I host it.

It\u2019s been fun to build, and I\u2019m learning more about how static sites work under the hood.\n\nA couple of things I couldn't finish (but plan to get back to):\n\n1)Redis Clone (C++ - Codecrafters)\nGot through 22/40 tasks but hit a nasty bug that I couldn\u2019t figure out(skills issues!!). Will take it up again when I have more time (or when I level up my debugging skills!).\n\n2)Next.js Application Tracker\nStarted building an app to track all my applications in one place.

They covered Reinforcement Fine-Tuning, medical research, and shared some truly punny jokes. Moments like these remind me why I love my team: brilliant people solving fascinating problems\u2014and having fun along the way! https://lnkd.in/gJnNiTXc\n\nIf you'd like to participate in the Research Program by sharing data, check out https://lnkd.in/gZYehx9T or ping me.\n\nReinforcement Fine-Tuning is a new technique for teaching the new models how to reason. It's kinda like how AlphaGo taught a model how to play by \"grading\" games, then learning what \"good\" moves are by comparing moves in winning vs losing games. This opens up a whole new paradigm for models, where you're not just teaching them the answer, but teaching them how to arrive at the right answer.\n\nWhat is Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT)?\nIt\u2019s a groundbreaking technique for teaching models how to reason. Think of it like AlphaGo: the model learns by being \u201cgraded\u201d on games and understanding what makes moves in winning games better than losing ones.\n\nWith RFT, prompts are like the \u201cgames\u201d and chain-of-thought reasoning is like the \u201cmoves.\u201d By evaluating the \"winning\" reasoning steps, the model learns which ones lead to better answers. This means we\u2019re not just teaching models the answers\u2014we\u2019re teaching them how to think through problems and consistently arrive at the right solutions.\n\nMy team\u2019s mission is simple: give you the world\u2019s best model for your domain. If you\u2019re finding it hard to get API responses to work for your business\u2014whether it\u2019s a performance issue, cost concern, or accuracy challenge\u2014let me know. We have tools to improve outcomes, and I love working with customers to see how we can do even more.\n\nOh, and Santa\u2019s sleigh? Julie gave us the answer: \u201cBecause he hadn\u2019t \u2018pine\u2019-tuned yet!\u201d \ud83e\udd41",
