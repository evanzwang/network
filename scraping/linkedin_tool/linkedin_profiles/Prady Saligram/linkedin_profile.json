This work addresses the critical gap in research on setting robust thresholds for LLM evaluation metrics, which are essential for the reliable deployment of LLMs. \n\nDrawing inspiration from model risk management practices in regulated industries like finance, we propose a systematic methodology to define these thresholds. The approach involves identifying risks associated with the specific application, understanding stakeholders' risk tolerance, and applying statistically rigorous procedures using ground-truth data.",

LoLCATS is a two-step method designed to efficiently improve the quality of linearized large language models without the need for expensive retraining on billions of tokens. The core idea behind LoLCATS is to first train linear attention mechanisms to match the softmax attentions of the original model using a mean squared error (MSE) loss in a process called \u201cattention transfer.\u201d Then, low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is employed to correct any residual errors in approximation, allowing the model to achieve high-quality predictions with significantly reduced computational costs. This method makes it feasible to create linearized versions of very large models, like Llama 3 8B and Mistral 7B, with minimal overhead.\n\nThe structure of LoLCATS involves two main stages. The first stage, attention transfer, focuses on training the linear attention to closely approximate the output of softmax attention. The researchers achieved this by parameterizing the linear attention using learnable feature maps, which are optimized to minimize the output discrepancy between the linear and softmax mechanisms. The second stage, low-rank linearizing, further improves model performance by leveraging LoRA to make small, low-rank adjustments to the linearized layers. This step compensates for the quality gaps that might emerge after the initial linearization. The LoLCATS framework also employs a block-by-block training approach, particularly for larger models, to make the process scalable and more memory-efficient...\n\nRead the full article here: https://lnkd.in/g9Xq28KV\n\nPre-Print Paper: https://lnkd.in/gym8Cyrm\n\nGitHub: https://lnkd.in/g_QMYEYY\nStanford University Simran A.

Enter LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), a game-changing technique that addresses these limitations, enabling efficient and practical fine-tuning of large language models.\n\nLoRA introduces a novel approach to fine-tuning by adding a small number of task-specific weights to the pre-trained model instead of updating all the weights. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Low-Rank Matrices: For each layer in the pre-trained model, LoRA introduces a pair of low-rank matrices: one for the weights and one for the biases.\n\n2. Adaptation: During fine-tuning, LoRA updates these low-rank matrices instead of modifying the pre-trained weights directly.\n\n3. Composition: At inference time, the low-rank matrices are composed with the pre-trained weights to produce the final, adapted weights for the fine-tuned model.\n\nThe low-rank nature of these matrices is the key to LoRA's efficiency, dramatically reducing the memory and computational requirements for fine-tuning. This makes it possible to adapt large language models even on consumer-grade hardware like CPUs or edge devices.\n\nBut LoRA's advantages don't stop there. It can match or even outperform the performance of full fine-tuning while using far fewer updatable parameters. Additionally, the LoRA updates are reversible, allowing the model to revert to its original state, and composable, enabling a single pre-trained model to be fine-tuned for multiple tasks simultaneously.\n\nTo illustrate the power of LoRA, let's dive into a practical example. Here, I'll demonstrate how to implement LoRA from scratch and fine-tune the DistilBERT model using LoRA on the IMDB dataset for sentiment analysis.\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/g-Tz2NU7\n\nAs you can see, LoRA is a remarkable technique that addresses the limitations of traditional fine-tuning methods, making it more efficient, practical, and versatile. By introducing low-rank, task-specific updates, LoRA enables efficient adaptation while preserving the model's original knowledge and allowing for multi-task specialization.\n\nAs the demand for deploying large language models on resource-constrained devices continues to grow, techniques like LoRA will make these powerful models more accessible and practical.",

TriForce utilizes the original model weights and dynamic sparse KV cache via retrieval as a draft model, serving as an intermediate layer in the hierarchy. Maintaining the full cache allows for superior KV cache selection using retrieval-based drafting, characterized as lossless compared to eviction-based methods like StreamingLLM and H2O. The hierarchical system addresses dual memory bottlenecks, pairing a lightweight model with a StreamingLLM cache for initial speculations to reduce drafting latency and accelerate end-to-end inference.\n\nTriForce introduces a hierarchical speculative decoding system with retrieval-based KV cache selection. The hierarchical system addresses dual bottlenecks, enhancing speed-up. Retrieval-based drafting segments the KV cache, highlighting relevant information. Lightweight models with StreamingLLM cache accelerate initial speculations, reducing drafting latency. TriForce utilizes model weights and KV cache to enhance LLM inference speed for long sequences. The implementation utilizes Transformers, FlashAttention, and PyTorch CUDA graphs, maintaining full layer sparsity while minimizing kernel launching overhead. \n\nPaper: https://lnkd.in/ga45hspw\n\nMachine Learning Department at CMU",

        "summary": "Ershad Khandker\n        \n              \n          \" Flatiron Institute senior research scientist Shiwei Zhang and his team have utilized the Hubbard model to computationally re-create key features of the superconductivity in materials called cuprates that have puzzled scientists for decades.\n\nSuperfast hovering trains, long-distance power transmission without energy loss, and quicker MRI scanners \u2014 all these incredible technological innovations could be within reach if we could develop a material that conducts electricity without any resistance, or \u201csuperconducts,\u201d at approximately room temperature.\n\nIn a paper recently published in the journal Science, researchers report a breakthrough in our understanding of the origins of superconductivity at relatively high (though still frigid) temperatures. The findings concern a class of superconductors that has puzzled scientists since 1986, called \u2018cuprates.\u2019\n\nThere was tremendous excitement when cuprate superconductors were discovered [in 1986], but no understanding of why they remain superconductive at such high temperatures,\u201d says Shiwei Zhang, a senior research scientist at the Flatiron Institute\u2019s Center for Computational Quantum Physics (CCQ). \u201cI think it\u2019s surprising to everybody that almost 40 years later, we still don\u2019t quite understand why they do what they do.\n\n\u2757\ufe0fIn the new paper, Zhang and his colleagues successfully re-created features of cuprate superconductivity with a simple model called the two-dimensional Hubbard model, which treats the materials as if they were electrons moving around a quantum chessboard. The breakthrough comes only a few years after the same researchers demonstrated that the simplest version of this model couldn\u2019t perform such a feat. Such straightforward models can spark a deeper understanding of physics, says study co-author Ulrich Schollw\u00f6ck, a professor at the University of Munich. \u2757\ufe0f\ud83d\udc48\n\nThe idea in physics is to keep the model as simple as possible because it\u2019s difficult enough on its own,\u201d Schollw\u00f6ck says. \u201cSo in the beginning we studied the simplest version imaginable.\u201d\n\nEnhancements to the Hubbard Model\nIn the new study, the researchers added to the 2D Hubbard model the ability for electrons to make diagonal hops, like bishops in chess. With this tweak and thousands of weeks-long simulations on supercomputers, the researchers\u2019 model captured the superconductivity and several other key features of cuprates previously found in experiments. By showing that the humble Hubbard model can describe cuprate superconductivity, the authors prove its worth as a platform for understanding why and how superconductivity emerges.\"\n\nAfter over 30 years of intense effort by the community without many reliable answers, it\u2019s often been argued that solving the Hubbard model would have to wait for a quantum computer,\u201d Zhang says. \u201cThis effort will not only advance research in high-temperature superconductivity, but hopefully also spur more research using \u2018classical\u2019 computation to explore the wonders of the quantum world.\u201d",
