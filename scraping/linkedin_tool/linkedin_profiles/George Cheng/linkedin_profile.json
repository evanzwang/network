My modest answer is, \"Yes, maybe\", (safety and on-vehicle AI stack is the toughest in this domain), (The engineering-stack playbook for this is sorta written even though not fully complete. I\u2019ll share my thoughts on AI side of things soon). IMO, one aspect that is missing is a geo-fenced, peer-to-peer network which should add a layer of resilience and reduce latency compared to current playbook.\n\nBut that conversation left me with a far more interesting question: Could we conceive of a harder challenge? What about an autonomous drone navigating high vortex wind fields? (just fun thought experiment)\n\nThe more I think about it, the clearer it becomes that this problem, and many others like it, exposes fundamental flaws in how we approach AI today. It demands a return to first principles. Back to the drawing board.\n\nThe first among many things that must change is how we do reinforcement learning (RL). The current state of RL is still predominantly discretized, and that is fundamentally inefficient.\n\nHere is a blog that outlines my perspective on why RL needs an update and what could happen if we rethink its foundations.\n\n#ReinforcementLearning #ArtificialIntelligence #AutonomousNavigation",

Lu, Bowen Chen, and Drew F. K. Williamson, introduced an AI-driven tool that accelerates CRISPR-based gene editing. \n\nThe approach combined the deep subject matter expertise of the team and augmenting this with models to enhance precision and efficiency of gene editing. Which then enables prediction of optimal CRISPR-Cas9 target sites, minimizing off-target effects and maximizing editing success.\n\nA key aspect of this advancement is the applied AI methodology, which integrates multi-modal datasets\u2014combining genomic, proteomic, and phenotypic data. This comprehensive data integration, coupled with subject matter expertise, enables the AI to make highly accurate predictions and refine gene-editing strategies. The synergy between AI and expert knowledge accelerates the development of precise and effective genetic modifications.\n\nThis breakthrough has implications for a wide range of genetic conditions. Diseases such as cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, and muscular dystrophy, which are caused by specific genetic mutations, can potentially be treated more effectively with precise gene-editing techniques. \n\nAdditionally, complex conditions like cancer, where multiple genetic factors are at play, could see advancements in targeted therapies, leading to personalized and more effective treatment options. The ability to edit genes with high precision opens new avenues for addressing rare genetic disorders, previously deemed untreatable, and accelerates the path toward innovative cures and interventions.\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/gV6YkzFH\n\n#GeneEditing #CRISPR #AI #Biotechnology #ResearchInnovation #AppliedAI #MultiModalData #GeneticConditions #PersonalizedMedicine",

They are all worth pondering (although I would not invoke Suleyman in # 3) but one that struck a chord with me, Thought # 6, summarizes two important themes: human augmentation and business (re)invention. Here is the thought:\n\n\"6. The simpler questions are about efficiency and effectiveness. The real question is more existential.\u00a0AI will deliver efficiencies by getting things done faster and cheaper and as importantly more effectively by unleashing insights and freeing talent to work on areas where humans excel and let the math and pattern finding and the rest be done by the machine. But the smart companies are thinking about how to re-invent, re-imagine and re-think their business. In the world we live today with distributed and unbundled work, next generation technologies and multi-polar globalization why are more companies not re-imagining their businesses versus just focussing on making yesterdays model cheaper and more effective?\"\n\nObvious pockets of inefficiencies will be addressed with #AI in the short term by businesses, thereby quickly eliminating any competitive advantage (a point made very nicely by Martin Reeves in a recent HBR article https://lnkd.in/gsaHk4V2). Any sustainable advantage will have to come from new ideas about augmentation (that amplify a company's unique assets) and from novel ideas in general for businesses. \n\nSo, first, augmentation. I have been for 25 years a proponent of thinking about \"unleashing insights and freeing talent to work on areas where humans excel and let the math and pattern finding and the rest be done by the machine\". What is missing from a lot of the discourse on augmentation is what form it should take, specifically, how do humans and AIs interface? The chatbot form factor has been surprisingly effective (surprising to me at least) at opening floodgates of creativity from all kinds of horizons. It can't be the last frontier of human-AI interfacing. That needs to be invented.\n\nWhich takes us to the second part: (re)invention. The winners will use #genAI to create new products, services, experiences that are not even conceivable without AI. Business model disruption driven by AI is just beginning. When you product or service can be 80% replaced by a self-serve AI-based version at 0.001% of the cost, you have to seriously rethink where you create value. And as Rishad Tobaccowala writes in thought # 7, \"A company\u2019s best opportunities and threats are likely come from outside its immediate category and AI allows it to extend into new areas.\"",

These equations extend well beyond the capabilities of symbolic solvers, and even Wolfram's numerical solvers buckle under the computational demands, halting progress altogether. Tackling these complex equations calls for an entirely new class of models designed to handle their intricacies. There is some ground up thinking required for SDEs honestly.\n\nFor simple stochastic differentials or low-dimensional problems, it\u2019s feasible to attempt a numerical approximation using Wolfram's numerical solvers, especially if one breaks down the SDE or imposes approximations that simplify the boundary behavior.\n\nI am also not a believer in the \"Computational Universe\" framework.

Many optimization problems can be reformulated from a probabilistic perspective to exploit the Fisher-Rao (Riemannian) geometric structure of a probability family. In this talk, we show how to design new quasi-Newton methods for large-scale neural network (NN) training by leveraging the geometric structure. We first establish a second-order view of adaptive methods such as RMSProp and full-matrix AdaGrad when the square root is removed from their preconditioned gradient step. After that, we introduce and use preconditioner invariance to make non-diagonal adaptive methods inverse-free while keeping their preconditioner structures for modern mini-batches training with low precision. Finally, we propose Kronecker-factored adaptive methods to bridge the computation gap between non-diagonal and diagonal adaptive methods and demonstrate the advantages of our methods for training large NNs in half-precision by removing numerically unstable and computationally intensive matrix decompositions and inversions.",

These advancements promise to offer unprecedented medical solutions for individuals grappling with illness or injury.\nYet, the quest for seamless integration of mechanical actuators with the human body calls for the development of sophisticated sensors. Imagine a sensor so advanced that it can stretch across both the body and mechanical components, akin to a second skin. This is where electronic skin (e-skin) enters the scene, poised to dissolve the once-clear boundary between organism and machine.\nHighlighted on page 735 of this issue, Wang et al. report the development of a neuromorphic e-skin system that astonishingly mimics the sensory feedback of our biological skin. \n\nThis is not just a step but a leap forward in the realm of neuro-robotics and prosthetics, setting the stage for a future where the line between the organic and the artificial becomes indistinguishable.\n\n\ud83d\udc47 Read the full article\n\n#artificialintelligence #robotics #biotech #prosthetics #brainmachineinterface #neurorobotics #electronicskin #neuromorphicsystems #humanmachineintegration #medicaltechnology #aiprosthetics #sensoryfeedback #biologicalmimicry #futureofmedicine #innovation #healthtech #smartprosthetics #cyberneticadvancements #aiinhealthcare #nextgenprosthetics",
