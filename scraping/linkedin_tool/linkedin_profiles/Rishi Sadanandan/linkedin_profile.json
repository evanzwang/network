This tool is designed to assist engineers in selecting the best materials and manufacturing processes. It\u2019s already functional, with a conversational interface that can handle basic material selection tasks, though there\u2019s still work to do.\n\nWhat I\u2019ve Accomplished:\n\n\t\u2022\tTrained and integrated a RandomForestClassifier model for material recommendations.\n\t\u2022\tBuilt a conversational interface for user interaction.\n\t\u2022\tImproved the AI\u2019s ability to handle different scenarios and make better recommendations.\n\nThis Week\u2019s Focus:\n\n\t\u2022\tEnhancing the AI\u2019s decision-making with a decision tree structure.\n\t\u2022\tImproving scenario recognition to make the AI more intuitive.\n\t\u2022\tImplementing a hybrid approach to better guide users through complex decision-making.\n    \u2022 Start the build of website 2.0.\n\nLong-Term Goals:\nMy vision is to launch CalculAI as a valuable tool for the engineering industry, secure funding to expand my team, and develop additional AI tools to address other engineering challenges.\n\nChallenges:\nWith no technical background in software development and experience as a project manager in the engineering industry, I\u2019ve self-taught myself web design and AI development. The journey has been filled with obstacles; many times I\u2019ve wanted to quit, but each day I pushed a little further.

It's not just about creating value; it's about capturing it effectively. In the world of startups and innovation, the VC2 framework offers a lens to understand this dynamic interplay.\n\nAt its core, PMF is about delivering a product that resonates deeply with customers while addressing a specific market need. But let's dive deeper. PMF extends beyond mere satisfaction, but also validate revenue models, ensuring your offering can be monetized successfully.\n\nHere's where the distinction between creating and capturing value becomes pivotal. To capture value, you must first create it. \nIn the realm of macroeconomics, value creation translates to enhancing customer experiences in B2C scenarios or boosting profitability for B2B entities. Pricing models play a crucial role here, as they must strike a balance between delivering value and capturing it.\n\nUltimately, the success of any product hinges on its ability to generate sustainable revenue. If a product or service fails to do so, its long-term viability comes into question. \n\nIn essence, PMF isn't just about creating buzz; it's about building a solid foundation for sustainable growth. By understanding the intricate dance between value creation and capture, entrepreneurs can steer their ventures towards lasting success. \n\nCourtesy : Harvard Kennedy School and The Lean Product Playbook.\n\n#ProductMarketFit #BusinessStrategy #Entrepreneurship #VC2",

His insights are fascinating.\n\nMost founders get the application process completely wrong. They think it's about perfect preparation and polished pitches.\n\nBut here's what actually worked for his team-\n\nTheir failed interview = 3 days of intense prep and mock interviews\u2026\n\u2022 They got \"destroyed\" by Michael Seibel because they were too rehearsed, too rigid.\n\nTheir successful interview = Zero preparation.\n\u2022 But backed by a year of actually running their business, understanding their market, and knowing their numbers cold.\n\nThe difference was the deep understanding that only comes from doing the work\u2026 not a better pitch.\n\nAnother counter-intuitive insight from Saad: YC partners send rejection emails that aren't always just rejections. When they suggest pivoting \"and letting them know,\" they mean it. Many successful YC founders took this path.\n\nHis data point about application time is telling too. Each reapplication took just 30 minutes - simple progress updates rather than complete rewrites.\n\nThis matches perfectly with YC's philosophy -- spend your time building, not perfecting applications.\n\nThe real secret to getting into YC is about having a real story to tell.",

From addressing labor shortages to reimagining entire industries, robotics is moving beyond automation into a realm of exponential possibilities.\n\nHere are a few key takeaways:\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 The \u201cWhy Now\u201d Moment: Robotics today is where self-driving was a decade ago\u2014poised for exponential growth, driven by breakthroughs in AI, machine learning, and Industry 4.0.\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Critical Challenges: Data scarcity and hardware costs are significant bottlenecks, as highlighted by Freda Duan (Altimeter Capital). However, with visionary founders and bold, first-principles thinking, these challenges can transform into opportunities for breakthrough innovation.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 The Right Approach: Robotics shouldn\u2019t just optimize workflows; it should enable full-stack transformations where robots power safer, faster, and smarter systems at scale.\n\nI had the privilege of learning from and collaborating with some brilliant minds in crafting this piece. Special thanks to Daniel Theobald (MassRobotics) and Wei Ding (Under Control Robotics) for their invaluable insights that shaped many of the themes in this post. I\u2019m also grateful for thought-provoking past conversations with Stefan Seltz-Axmacher (Polymath Robotics), David Li (BHP Ventures), Lawrence Wong (Tesla), and the Optimus team from Tesla\u2019s Robotaxi event, which helped me think critically about where to focus and find the right voices for deeper exploration.\n\nBig shoutout to Jaireh Tecarro and Jen Liao for their incredible feedback and support\u2014your input made this better. \ud83d\ude4f\n\nIf robotics fascinates you as much as it does me, check out the post and let me know your thoughts. Would also love it if you could share this with others who might find value in it. Let\u2019s reimagine the future together.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 [Link in the comments]",

A normal VC firm pools capital together to create a fund and invests out of that fund. The syndicate system invests in startups on a deal by deal basis! If any of that is confusing to you, and you want to start VC investing without any of your own money, make sure you listen to Ep 019 of \u201cNew to Venture\u201d!\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Provide value first. Try your best to be helpful! Don\u2019t just say it, find ways to do it. Many VCs are ridiculed for saying \u201cLet me know how I can be helpful\u201d but never actually being helpful. Try to not be that person. \n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 VC funds follow a 2 and 20 structure, meaning that 2% of the fund is given to the firm every year to manage the money and after the firm returns the fund they get to keep 20% of the profits. An SPV structure is similar, but there are 2 main differences. For early stage investments, the management fees are negotiable, nonexistent, a one time fee, or lower than 2%. Second, SPVs don\u2019t have to return an entire fund's worth of capital before they see a dollar of profit, just the initial investment amount. \n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Signaling plays a huge role in the world of syndicates. Since a syndicate lead has to raise money from LPs on every deal, good signaling (strong co-investors) garner more interest.\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 When you\u2019re young, you tend to be aggressive about helping with everything. Ultimately, that's a trap, be realistic with what you can actually provide and over deliver on that thing. Under promise and over deliver.\n\n5\ufe0f\u20e3 Staying top of mind is difficult. Some best practices include grabbing in-person coffee, quarterly calls, and posting content. Building an online presence is an underutilized method to staying top of mind!\n\nListen on Spotify: https://lnkd.in/drziG2Mt \n\nListen on Apple Podcasts: https://lnkd.in/d4dC6WmC \n\n#NewtoVenture #VentureCapital #Startups #VC #CEO #Business #Investing #recruiting #networking",
