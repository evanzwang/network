LLMs are becoming more capable every month it seems, and one industry that people feel it will disrupt the most is software engineering. Given that LLMs can write syntactically perfect code, many feel that it will make learning to program obsolete soon. However, I think it'll be more like the calculator to math, or the printing press to writing: both were disruptive, yet innovative, tools for their respective fields, but ultimately they both helped increase the scale and complexity of calculations that could be performed and books that could be written, respectively.\n\n\"Today, we are at a point where computers (i.e., AI) do not need this intermediate level of translation between the language we speak and the one they understand. We can set aside the Rosetta Stone and just speak English to a computer. They will likely understand just as well as when speaking to them in Python. This immediately presents two choices: We can get lazy, or we can elevate our thought.\"\n\nThanks for the rec. Philip Walsh, PhD!",

With generative AI, we\u2019re going to be able to not only generate more ideas and predict with better accuracy, but we\u2019re also going to be able to model biology in new and exciting ways so that when we put a new chemical entity into the clinic, we have a higher success rate.

Unlocking New Frontiers in Protein Structure Prediction \ud83e\uddec\nAfter six months of anticipation, Google DeepMind has officially released AlphaFold3\u2019s software code, making it available for non-commercial use. This breakthrough comes as John Jumper, AlphaFold\u2019s lead, and Demis Hassabis recently won a Nobel Prize for their pioneering work.\nSo, what\u2019s new with AlphaFold3?\nUnlike AlphaFold2, AlphaFold3 can model proteins in combination with other molecules. This powerful upgrade is set to transform drug discovery, as researchers can now simulate protein interactions with drug candidates\u2014a feature previously limited by server access.\nThe Path to Openness\nDespite initially withholding the code to balance accessibility with commercial interests, DeepMind\u2019s decision to release the model paves the way for academic advancements. While some parameters, such as training weights, remain restricted to academic requests, this release is a huge win for scientific reproducibility and collaborative research.\nBut DeepMind\u2019s Not Alone\u2026\nAs DeepMind launches AlphaFold3, other companies have jumped on the protein-prediction scene. ByteDance, Baidu, and San Francisco\u2019s Chai Discovery have each launched their own versions, with Ligo Biosciences offering a restriction-free model and OpenFold3 soon to follow.\nWhy It Matters\nThis open-access move is more than just a release; it\u2019s about fostering a culture of scientific transparency. As Anthony Gitter from the University of Wisconsin-Madison puts it, \"Open science requires that when claims are made, others can inspect the tools.\"\nThis is just the beginning. With AlphaFold3 now accessible, the scientific community is set to take protein structure predictions to a whole new level. \ud83c\udf10\ud83d\udca1\n#AlphaFold3 #DeepMind #OpenScience #DrugDiscovery #AIinBiology #NobelPrize \n\nsource: https://lnkd.in/dA9XDr74",

However, in healthcare, where we deal with intricate biological systems, these extra layers can paradoxically increase clinicians' cognitive load. It's like providing a detailed engine schematic when someone just needs to know if the car will start.\n\nB) The Trust-Performance Tightrope\nMore accurate models often capture nuanced interactions between variables.

A model that perfectly explains occlusion or thrombosis of a shunt isn't helpful if that explanation takes too long to process during a critical moment.\n--Critical Insight: The goal isn't just to make models interpretable but to make their interpretability actionable and trustworthy for healthcare providers.\n\n*** Key Developments\n1) Regulatory Ripple Effect\n - Interpretable AI is creating new medicolegal and ethical frontiers\n - Questions of liability in AI recommendations\n - Added complexity in model development and deployment\n\n2) The Bias-Awareness Benefit\n - Better identification and addressing of biases\n - Improved racial equity\n - Enhanced scientific reproducibility in healthcare AI\n\nQuestion for Discussion\nWhat are your thoughts on navigating the delicate balance between model transparency, complexity, and clinical utility in healthcare AI?\n\n#HealthcareAI #Interpretability #ResponsibleAI #MachineLearning #MedicalEthics #Explainability",

This approach is particularly relevant to the recently introduced Med-Gemini models, which leverage web search integration to improve clinical reasoning capabilities. The key steps in ADAPT-LLM are:\n\n1. Prompt the LLM with just the question. If answered correctly, parametric memory suffices. If not, flag the question as requiring retrieval.\n\n2. Construct a training set from an open-domain QA dataset. For correctly answered questions, provide only the Q&A. For others, add a <RET> token to indicate retrieval is needed, along with the Q&A and gold passage.\n\n3. Fine-tune the LLM on this dataset to learn when to answer directly or retrieve via <RET>.\n\nAt inference, ADAPT-LLM either answers directly or outputs <RET>, triggering retrieval of a relevant passage that is appended to the question prompt for generating the final answer.\n\nExperiments used Llama-2 (7B) fine-tuned on NQ and SQuAD, with Contriever for retrieval. On PopQA, ADAPT-LLM outperformed never/always retrieve baselines and matched a popularity-score approach. When ADAPT-LLM chose to retrieve, accuracy was significantly higher with context. When answering directly, it achieved high accuracy from parametric memory alone. Retrieval quality was a key bottleneck.\n\nThe adaptive retrieval approach in ADAPT-LLM aligns well with the uncertainty-guided search strategy employed by Med-Gemini-L 1.0 for complex clinical reasoning tasks. By selectively integrating web search results based on model uncertainty, Med-Gemini-L 1.0 achieved state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like MedQA. The success of both ADAPT-LLM and Med-Gemini highlights the importance of judiciously leveraging external information to complement the parametric knowledge of large language models, enabling improved question-answering performance in both open-domain and specialized medical contexts.\n\nFurthermore, one could envision an extension of this framework wherein the language model is trained to generate intermediate annotations or structured representations of the retrieved information that it deems most pertinent to the query at hand, akin to the note-taking process employed by human experts when researching a topic. This could potentially enhance the model's ability to distill and synthesize relevant knowledge from the retrieved context, leading to more accurate and informative final responses.",
