    "about": "Hi, I'm Joel. I like to create software, machines, and climate solutions.Among my software projects, Buseroo.com helps students find which school bus goes to any address, Homework Checker helps 2,000 students manage their homework, Focus for Google Docs helps 1,000 people write without distractions, Edit Time helps 4,000 people manage their file's last modified properties, and LirongArt.com showcases my mom's paintings.As for physical projects, I built a vending machine that served snacks to people at school, Jacob's ladder that acts as my morning alarm, a wooden pinball machine, and a slayer exciter. You can explore my projects in more depth below:Regarding climate change, I helped bring a solar installation to Riverdale Country School, which will reduce emissions by 250 metric tons of CO\u2082 equivalent each year, save Riverdale money, supply backup power during outages, and provide live energy data for use in the science curriculum. I founded Students for Electric Buses, a club attempting to transition Riverdale's bus provider to electric school buses. I also did research on organic solar cells at New York University's Lee Research Lab. Finally, I served on Manhattan Community Board One's Environmental Protection Committee, which plans Lower Manhattan's climate resiliency projects, and the Youth & Education Committee. I worked with the Mayor's Office of Climate and Environmental Justice and Street Vendor Project on connecting street vendors to the electrical grid instead of using gas generators.To see my projects, go to joelgrayson.com",
