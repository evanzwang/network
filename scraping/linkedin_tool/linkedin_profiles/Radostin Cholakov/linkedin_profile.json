We present a novel method for quantization of LLMs, which stores their parameters in 4 bits while maintaining a performance level comparable to full-precision models. The weight matrices are split into blocks, and for each block, quantization bins are computed as quantiles of a probability distribution.

To address these limitations, we propose two models with auxiliary tasks for response selection - (1) distinguishing distractors from ground truth responses and (2) distinguishing synthetic\u2026\n            \n\n    \n    \n\n    \n        Show more",
