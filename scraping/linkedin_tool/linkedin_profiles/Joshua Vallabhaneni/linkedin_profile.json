        "summary": "Prakhar Sinha\n        \n              \n          A few short days ago, I wrapped up my research position at UC Davis Health with Professor Farzad Fereidouni. My role at the lab entailed a specialization in machine learning and computer vision and I'm excited to share what I was able to accomplish with everyone. \n\nI worked on two projects during my time at the lab. The first one was something I called \"Kernel Generation for Image Similarity\" (https://lnkd.in/ghsY73ts). It was to process an image such that it would look like it was H&E stained. I learned a lot about the basics of histology and digital histology through this process. The most novel part of this approach was using Wiener deconvolution to generate a kernel that would be used to enhance image similarity (typically using SSIM, MSE or a combination of both). \n\nA big part of this process was optimization. I learned how to use Python libraries such as Cupy and other tools to GPU accelerate a lot of these image-processing optimization problems.\n\nMy second project and my most meaningful contribution was called \"FastSAM-needle-biopsy\" (https://lnkd.in/gXXydq-X). The objective of this project was to use the FastSAM image segmentation network to accurately generate image segmentation masks of live tissue such that a microscope would only scan the relevant parts of an image. Here is step by step walkthrough of the image processing pipeline:\n\n1) VB.NET (Darius) application calls a DLL (compiled from csharp.NET)\n2) DLL calls FastSAM image segmentation code using Python.NET\n3) FastSAM segments image and returns image segmentation bitmask and as well as the fastest path to visit every bit (Traveling Salesman Problem)\n4) Python returns values are returned to DLL using JSON as a reliable data transfer solution\u00a0\n5) DLL returns an object that can be parsed by VB.NET\n\nFastSAM is a faster version of Meta Research's Segment Anything Model and I used it to greatly speed up development time on this project. It was a big challenge to integrate such cutting-edge, machine-learning driven, image processing pipelines into a legacy codebase that was written in Visual Basic .NET but thanks to tools such as DLLs, JSON, and C#, I was able to figure it out!\n\nI am very grateful for the time I spent in the lab. I feel like I developed some great programming skills, especially in computer vision, that will prove useful for the rest of my career. I'd like to give special thanks to Professor Fereidouni, Ruby Mascareno, Willy Ju, Dena Sayrafi, Ruben Gnanaruban, Inyola, Antara Mallick, and Jayla. \n\nThe link is here if you'd like to see my lab report going over everything I did in more technical detail and with a few pictures!\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/gRpZVmjG\n\n#computervision #machinelearning #AI #histology",

It leverages Tree of Thought Planning to break down complex goals into hierarchical subtasks, explore multiple reasoning paths, and optimize task sequences through recursive evaluation.\n \ud83d\udd39 Action Agent: Executes complex behaviors through code generation, iterative refinement, and environment feedback, leveraging a shared skill library for long-horizon tasks. \n\ud83d\udd39 Critic Agent: Evaluates task outcomes using visual and contextual data, providing feedback to refine strategies and improve decision-making. It employs Tree of Thought Evaluation to assess intermediate steps, validate alternative reasoning paths, and refine outputs based on logical consistency. \ud83d\udd39 Skill Manager: Stores and retrieves executable behaviors, enabling continuous learning and scalability for complex tasks.\n\ud83e\udd16 Multi-Bot System I also developed a multi-bot system that extends the Voyager framework, enabling multiple bots to operate concurrently in the same Minecraft world.

Thank you Microsoft and PyData NYC for hosting and putting on this event, and thank you Arthur Anderson for your wonderful portion of the presentation! (Side remark: after the presentation, I was absolutely stoked when someone told me that I should be a professor after college \ud83d\ude04)\n\nI'm taking advantage of this post to provide a few small updates: Going forward, I'll be working on more software engineering tasks with the Aerospike Graph team, and I'll simultaneously learn more about distributed systems, get deeper into algorithmic design & analysis, and spend more time with C++. I plan to post something more reflective about my gap semester experience and what I have learned , but here is a list of some other things that I have enjoyed recently outside of my internship:\n\n- \ud83d\udcd3 Reengaging with my Applied Mathematics courses in nontraditional ways. Without exams to study for, I've taken full advantage of this time to relearn a slew of topics from original principles, and this has been a tremendously fruitful and satisfying process. Additionally, considering the context in which mathematical concepts were discovered has boosted my appreciation for my interests. I highly recommend \"The History of Mathematical Proof in Ancient Traditions\" by Karine Chemla if the math-history intersection intrigues you. \n\n- \ud83e\udd7e Getting outdoors more often. Whether it's walking my dog, running, or backpacking for a couple of days, I've been making a conscious effort to rejuvenate my mind and avoid any shred of mental stagnancy at all costs. Side note: I saw my first barn owl last night (indeed, I love birdwatching). \n\n- \ud83d\udcda \ud83c\uddeb\ud83c\uddf7 Cultivating a couple of daily habits. I have made doing (duo-ing?) my Duolingo lessons a priority, and I now realize that my years of Latin are finally paying off with other European languages. I've also made daily reading a priority, and I have set a fairly modest goal of one book a month. I'm right on track so far!\n\nI'm very proud of (1) my work and (2) my work-life balance thus far, and I'm absolutely looking forward to the upcoming academic year. There are various reflections that I've unearthed over the past 6 months or so, and I certainly plan to articulate them here towards the end of this summer!",

I ended up doing this research project, where I combined my passion for Design of Algorithms to achieve Computational Savings in Deep Neural Networks. \n\nI proposed to implement Hashing, in specific, Localitity Sensitive Hashing, but with a twist, to group weights by similarity, choose a weight representative by bucket, and prune the ones who were not the representative. \n\nThis not only ended up with computational savings (same performance with 99% less FLOPs, and 99% less parameters), but also acted as a form of regularization for better generalization. \n\n\ud83c\udf1f  Here is the GitHub repo: https://lnkd.in/gdsCHWGe \n\nThere is still more to add to this research project, and I am looking forward to do it in the followig months.",
