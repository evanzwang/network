As you start to learn about new tools and technologies, you start seeing opportunities everywhere.\n\nOne day, I was on Levels.fyi checking what my salary at Meta could look like if I was full-time\ud83d\ude02, and then the idea struck me: What if there was a similar platform for looking up online assessment scores?\n\nThe idea kept resurfacing in my mind, especially when I saw members of the ColorStack community frequently asking questions like \"is 470 a good CodeSignal score?\" It became clear there was a gap to fill. There was a need for a solution \u2013 a platform where candidates could benchmark their technical assessment scores.\n\nTo validate this idea, I created a waitlist to gauge interest in such a platform. The response was amazing!\n\nIn under 48 hours, over 140 people signed up! \ud83e\udd2f\n\nThis confirmed that I wasn\u2019t alone and that candidates need a reliable way to benchmark their OA scores.

FEM works, but it can be slow and might not play nice with data from sensors and other sources. That's where PINNs come in. They take a fresh approach by baking the physics right into the neural network's training process. This not only makes things faster but can also give more accurate results.\n\nTo get a feel for how PINNs work, let's think about modeling how temperature changes along a rod using the heat equation, a classic PDE. With PINNs, we build a neural network that spits out the temperature at any point on the rod, at any time.\n\nTo train this network, we use a loss function that focuses on the residual of the heat equation at different spots in the domain, which we call colocation points. By placing these points strategically, we make sure the network learns the right temperature distribution based on the physics of heat transfer. The heat equation,\n\n\u2202u/\u2202t = \u03b1 \u2202\u00b2u/\u2202x\u00b2,\n\nwhere u is temperature, t is time, x is position along the rod, and \u03b1 is thermal diffusivity, is the foundation for the training process.\n\nBy making the network's predictions match the known behavior from the heat equation at the colocation points, the neural network learns to stick to the physical laws that govern heat distribution. This lets the PINN predict temperature even where we don't have direct measurements, which is a powerful tool for tackling complex physics problems using machine learning.\n\nI actually tried this myself recently by using PINNs to solve the heat equation for a rod. I used a library called JAX (which I am still learning), which is great for automatic differentiation. It was a cool experience that showed me how PINNs could be used in real-world situations. :)\n\nCheck out my code: https://lnkd.in/ehfFypQK\nCheck out the paper: https://lnkd.in/ebgb2TgP\nDefinitely Checkout Professor Brunton's playlist on this, he's the OG \ud83d\ude4c : https://lnkd.in/ecUnwKsS",

I\u2019ve been working on these notes over the past few months, starting back when I TA'd EE 263 - Linear Dynamical Systems this past Summer. The course is offered by the Electrical Engineering Department at Stanford. It\u2019s also cross-listed with the Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering (ICME).\nThe course is mainly intended for first-year Ph.D. students in engineering fields (like Electrical Engineering, Aero/Astro, etc.), and it\u2019s a recommended prerequisite for the Convex Optimization course, EE 364a. Having taken EE 263 before EE 364a, I can say firsthand how crucial it is in helping you understand the material for the latter course.\nEE 263 focuses on applied linear algebra and dynamical systems, covering core concepts like range, null space, matrix exponentials, as well as very relevant applications, like least-squares estimates.\nWhile assisting in teaching the course, I often heard from students that the lecture slides alone weren\u2019t always enough for them to fully grasp the material.\nTo help with this, I started writing more detailed notes that expand on the course content. These notes are helpful as a companion to the lectures but aren't completely self-contained\u2014especially in the sections on linear dynamical systems. I plan to continue adding more content and examples over the coming months.\nOne part of these notes I\u2019m particularly proud of is the plots and visualizations/figures I made to explain key concepts, which were created using some convex combination of LaTeX, Julia and Python.\nHere is the link to the notes:\nhttps://lnkd.in/ggBNKQ8E",

Enter LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), a game-changing technique that addresses these limitations, enabling efficient and practical fine-tuning of large language models.\n\nLoRA introduces a novel approach to fine-tuning by adding a small number of task-specific weights to the pre-trained model instead of updating all the weights. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Low-Rank Matrices: For each layer in the pre-trained model, LoRA introduces a pair of low-rank matrices: one for the weights and one for the biases.\n\n2. Adaptation: During fine-tuning, LoRA updates these low-rank matrices instead of modifying the pre-trained weights directly.\n\n3. Composition: At inference time, the low-rank matrices are composed with the pre-trained weights to produce the final, adapted weights for the fine-tuned model.\n\nThe low-rank nature of these matrices is the key to LoRA's efficiency, dramatically reducing the memory and computational requirements for fine-tuning. This makes it possible to adapt large language models even on consumer-grade hardware like CPUs or edge devices.\n\nBut LoRA's advantages don't stop there. It can match or even outperform the performance of full fine-tuning while using far fewer updatable parameters. Additionally, the LoRA updates are reversible, allowing the model to revert to its original state, and composable, enabling a single pre-trained model to be fine-tuned for multiple tasks simultaneously.\n\nTo illustrate the power of LoRA, let's dive into a practical example. Here, I'll demonstrate how to implement LoRA from scratch and fine-tune the DistilBERT model using LoRA on the IMDB dataset for sentiment analysis.\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/g-Tz2NU7\n\nAs you can see, LoRA is a remarkable technique that addresses the limitations of traditional fine-tuning methods, making it more efficient, practical, and versatile. By introducing low-rank, task-specific updates, LoRA enables efficient adaptation while preserving the model's original knowledge and allowing for multi-task specialization.\n\nAs the demand for deploying large language models on resource-constrained devices continues to grow, techniques like LoRA will make these powerful models more accessible and practical.",

As the buzz of Telegraph Avenue dims slightly, we undergrads know it\u2019s our cue to hunker down and hit the books one last time before finals. Here are some key points I've been focusing on as we wrap up this dead week!\n\nLesson 1: Structure in Chaos\nBerkeley\u2019s Dead Week is ironically alive with a flurry of review sessions and last-minute project deadlines. I've found that a structured approach\u2014breaking down study sessions into focused blocks\u2014helps me navigate this intense week. The serene backdrop of the Bay Area, from the calming waters by the marina to the redwoods around campus, provides the perfect study break scenery to clear my mind and reset.\n\nLesson 2: The Strength of Shared Struggles\nThere's something about the communal silence of Mainstacks Library during Dead Week that reminds you you're not alone. Joining forces with other students, we grind out practice exams and Pomodoro sessions until 2 am. It's these moments of collaboration that transform challenging content into shared victories.\n\nLesson 3: Well-being as a Priority\nDead Week at Berkeley is not just about academic survival but also about maintaining well-being amidst the madness. I make it a point to keep up with my runs through the Fire Trails, ensuring that my mental and physical health aren\u2019t sidelined during these critical times.\n\nLesson 4: Reflection and Readiness\nAs I review notes and practice problems, I\u2019m also reflecting on how each semester builds more than just technical skills. It hones resilience, deepens patience, and expands my understanding of what I can achieve under pressure.\n\nWith finals on the horizon, I feel prepared and eager to tackle the challenges ahead.

To my unfortunate luck, when I woke up, the GPU time had run out, dragging the whole progress back to 0. \ud83d\ude13\n\nSo, it was basically a task assigned to me, and now it has been changed to check different models' working accuracy on this dataset, like LSTM, GRU, and CONV1D, among others. Can't say much about whether I will continue completing this or not due to time limitations and all, but we'll see that later. \ud83e\udd14\n\nUntil then, keep supporting and connecting to ride along on this FYP journey! \ud83d\ude4c\n#FYP #AI #LearningJourney #EarlyRetirement #FinalYearProject #LLM #Support #GameDevelopment",

        "summary": "Ajay Mallya\n        \n              \n          I'm grateful to have had the opportunity to travel back to dear NYC for a couple of days and present about some fundamental theoretical components of the Aerospike vector database. Thank you Microsoft and PyData NYC for hosting and putting on this event, and thank you Arthur Anderson for your wonderful portion of the presentation! (Side remark: after the presentation, I was absolutely stoked when someone told me that I should be a professor after college \ud83d\ude04)\n\nI'm taking advantage of this post to provide a few small updates: Going forward, I'll be working on more software engineering tasks with the Aerospike Graph team, and I'll simultaneously learn more about distributed systems, get deeper into algorithmic design & analysis, and spend more time with C++. I plan to post something more reflective about my gap semester experience and what I have learned , but here is a list of some other things that I have enjoyed recently outside of my internship:\n\n- \ud83d\udcd3 Reengaging with my Applied Mathematics courses in nontraditional ways. Without exams to study for, I've taken full advantage of this time to relearn a slew of topics from original principles, and this has been a tremendously fruitful and satisfying process. Additionally, considering the context in which mathematical concepts were discovered has boosted my appreciation for my interests. I highly recommend \"The History of Mathematical Proof in Ancient Traditions\" by Karine Chemla if the math-history intersection intrigues you. \n\n- \ud83e\udd7e Getting outdoors more often. Whether it's walking my dog, running, or backpacking for a couple of days, I've been making a conscious effort to rejuvenate my mind and avoid any shred of mental stagnancy at all costs. Side note: I saw my first barn owl last night (indeed, I love birdwatching). \n\n- \ud83d\udcda \ud83c\uddeb\ud83c\uddf7 Cultivating a couple of daily habits. I have made doing (duo-ing?) my Duolingo lessons a priority, and I now realize that my years of Latin are finally paying off with other European languages. I've also made daily reading a priority, and I have set a fairly modest goal of one book a month. I'm right on track so far!\n\nI'm very proud of (1) my work and (2) my work-life balance thus far, and I'm absolutely looking forward to the upcoming academic year. There are various reflections that I've unearthed over the past 6 months or so, and I certainly plan to articulate them here towards the end of this summer!",

See you there! \ud83d\ude80\n\nRecent developments in large speech models like OpenAI's Whisper have revolutionized automatic speech recognition (ASR). However, our latest research reveals a critical vulnerability in these systems.\n\n\ud83d\udd0d Key Findings: We discovered that Whisper's use of special tokens, such as <endoftext>, can be exploited by adversarial attacks. By inserting a learned universal 0.64-second audio segment, we can \"mute\" the model, forcing it to ignore actual speech and transcribe only the special token. This attack was effective over 97% of the time, even across different datasets and tasks!\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Why It Matters:\nRisks: Potential misuse to bypass speech moderation systems.\nOpportunities: A novel way to protect private speech data.\nThis research opens up important discussions on the security and ethics of deploying large ASR models in real-world applications.\n\n\ud83d\udcc4 Thanks to the first author Vyas Raina and other coauthors Charles McGhee Kate Knill Mark Gales.

        "summary": "Rolando Rivera\n        \n              \n          Hello LinkedIn Friends,  \n\nI\u2019m excited to introduce you to Nolan Maske from NCA&T University. Nolan and his team won first place in the Fall 2024 Hackathon with Goldman Sachs!\n\nEven more impressive is the application they developed to win the competition. They created a web app called PredictFi, designed to predict future earnings for financial companies. Congratulations, Nolan and team! \n\nIf you follow my posts on LinkedIn, you know that Market Leader Game (MLG) also predicts future earnings. At first glance, you might think PredictFi and MLG are similar.  Both use statistical modeling to forecast earnings. For example, MLG\u2019s algorithm identifies NASDAQ or NYSE stock symbols that are most likely to experience significant price increases over the next 12 months.\n\n@Nolan, it would be fascinating to learn more about the context and objectives behind future earnings predictions in PredictFi.\n\nMLG selects stock symbols with the highest probable growth rates by combining and then comparing:\n- Monte Carlo-generated stock prices,\n- Actual growth rates from the past 12 months, and\n- Detailed analysis of income statements and balance sheets.\n\nI purchased 3 stocks in 05/24 and 2 more in 10/24 to test the model.  The performance (as of today) has been remarkable  - 148% growth in 6 months:\n\nThe difference between MLG and PredictFi became clearer when I asked Nolan if his team used another statistical model to derive future earnings. \n\nNolan replied (paraphrasing):\n\"PredictFi uses ARIMA  (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average). The application assumes past patterns in data will continue. The team did not have sufficient time to explore the uncertainties and random outcomes that Monte Carlo could address.\"\n\nHis response piqued my interest, leading me to dive deeper into the differences between Monte Carlo Simulation and ARIMA.\n\nHere\u2019s what I found:\n\nARIMA Modeling Strengths:\n\nTime-series focus: Well-suited for capturing trends, seasonality, and autocorrelations in stock prices.\n\nDeterministic forecasts: Based on past patterns and relationships within the data.\n\nSimpler assumptions: Assumes that historical patterns will persist.\n\nMonte Carlo Simulation Strengths:\nFlexibility: Models multiple potential price paths using randomness and volatility.\n\nCaptures stochastic behavior: Reflects the uncertainty and randomness of financial markets.\n\nUse Case: Best for long-term risk assessment, scenario analysis, and when uncertainty and volatility are key factors.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nUse ARIMA for short-term forecasting and when historical trends dominate.\nUse Monte Carlo for long-term forecasting, risk assessment, and probabilistic scenarios.\n\nCombining these methods or integrating them with other models (e.g., machine learning or GARCH for volatility analysis) often yields the best insights.\n\nI hope this comparison sheds some light on these powerful predictive tools. \n\nCongratulations again to Nolan and his team for their impressive achievement!",
