Like a software engineer brainstorming genetic modification of mycelia, or a senior executive ideating process improvements which they haven't been participated in for decades.\n\nIt's challenging, exhausting, and ultimately self-defeating. \n\nEnter the concept of the \"Adjacent Possible\" - a game-changer for innovation. What is it?\n\nThe Adjacent Possible, coined by Stuart Kauffman, represents the realm of new ideas within reach based on our current knowledge, resources, and capabilities.\n\nWhy it matters:\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f Realistic Innovation: it focuses on achievable advancements, not far-fetched concepts.\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f Incremental Progress: each innovation opens doors to new possibilities.\n\nHow to leverage it:\n\u2022 Constantly explore the boundaries of your adjacent possible. What's in your line of sight is what you know best.\n\n\u2022 Combine existing ideas in novel ways. Even small perturbations from status quo can generate large innovation leaps.\n\n\u2022 Stay curious about developments in adjacent industries. Cross-domain patterns create fresh sources of ideas, while also expanding the adjacent possible.\n\nMost of all, it takes the 'genius' pressure off the team. No one knows everything, but each one of us knows a lot about something, and we can all drive plenty of innovation potential by focusing on the spaces we know best.\n\nAre you exploring your Adjacent Possible?

        "summary": "Henry Diep\n        \n              \n          Today, I found a fascinating way to think about \u201cTokens\u201d in LLMs. It came from a conversation between Jensen Huang and Patrick Collison at a recent Stripe event.\n\nWhen asked about the future of compute capacity in five years, Jensen smartly dodged that question a bit, but then gave an excellent explanation and analogy about why tokens are the new forces that will power the next decades of humanity.\n\nHe explained that we're now producing something unprecedented (and at scale): floating point numbers that possess \u201cvalue\u201d, which we now call tokens. These tokens are valuable because they encapsulate \u201cintelligence\u201d.\n\nPeople are now taking these tokens and transforming them into English, French, images, videos, chemicals, proteins, robotic movements, etc. And many are working hard to expand the range of concepts and ideas we can create with these tokens.\n\nHe then goes on to made a compelling comparison between tokens and electricity.\n\nIn the past industrial revolution, we successfully found a way to convert \u201catoms\u201d into \u201celectrons\u201d (by boiling water to power electricity turbines). And now, we've discovered a way to convert \"electrons\" into \"tokens\" (by using energy to power data centers that train and run LLMs).\n\nWhen electricity was first introduced, few people understood its value. Today, paying for kilowatts is routine. The same will happen with tokens. Right now, only early adopters and builders are paying tokens. Soon, everyone will be paying for tokens on a daily basis to supercharge productivity and power new products and services. Many new industries will be born from and built on top of tokens.\n\nWhen I first heard about this way of thinking, I got goosebumps. Perhaps it\u2019s because Jensen has a good storytelling skill that helps him sell what he builds, but I have to admit this way of thinking gave me a brief surge of pride. I'm proud of humanity's collective effort and creativity, which have taken us from living under rocks to building machines that can \"think.\" That's nothing short but a miracle.",

We had vaguely heard about YC from a friend who had just gotten accepted but had no plans of applying whatsoever.\n\nHowever when the YC deadline rolled around, we spontaneously decided to put in an application on the very last day. We spent that whole day in Karun\u2019s dorm room typing up the application and filming all the required videos. We finally hit submit the minute of the deadline!\n\nBy the next day we had already moved on. We went back to the usual rhythm of coding in the dorm room, calling with doctors, attending conferences, etc. If anything, we were even more motivated now to get more traction and be successful regardless.\n\nLater that week, while we were eating in the dorm kitchen, I noticed I got an email saying we had a YC interview scheduled. My heart rate spiked. I jumped up out of my seat and immediately told Karun. I never seriously considered YC, but for the first time it hit me that it might actually be a possibility.\n\nWhen the day of the interview rolled around, we did mock interviews with former YC founders and focused mostly on calming our nerves. More important than the actual content of the interview, we wanted to show our excitement for building and hacking together as co-founders.\n\nUnfortunately the interview caught us by surprise. The group partners didn't seem to care as much about our actual AI medical scribe. Instead, they seemed more curious about a side idea we had listed in our application that we wrote up in a day. The idea was about streamlining HIPAA compliance (since we had to go through HIPAA for our AI medical scribe).\n\nBy this point, we were already seriously considering pivoting into this and had made a lot of progress on the idea. The YC interview was our tipping point\n\nNot too long after, we got an ominous email titled \u201cYC.\u201d We were freaked out. I could not sleep the entire night. Then, in the middle of class the next day, I got a phone call from Karun with Surbhi on the other end of the line. My heart rate spiked. I ran outside of the classroom.\n\nThat turned out to be our acceptance call:)\n\n--\n\nFor everyone out there still waiting to hear back, just keep grinding. Build as if you\u2019ve been rejected and you might just be pleasantly surprised.\n\nI\u2019m also always here to help with mock interviews/give advice! We\u2019ve helped a handful of friends through the YC app process and are always here to support other founders!",

        "summary": "Sean Grossman\n        \n              \n          In March, I left Strac (YC W22) to build something new (more on this soon). Here are my key takeaways from taking Strac from zero to one:\n\n\nWhile at Strac, my favorite part of the role was always taking an engineering-first approach to our go-to-market motion. I loved tinkering, and frankly there's never been a more exciting time to do so as AI rapidly changes how effective sales teams function. Some of my favorite projects at Strac included writing a script to set up emails optimized for outbound deliverability, building a web scraper to check if a company was SOC2 compliant, and integrating our sales tech stack for seamless retargeting and outreach.\n\nThe most impactful lessons:\n1. Sales is a Numbers Game:\nFive years ago, sales teams relied heavily on traditional methods like cold calling and emailing purchased conference lists. However, nowadays, mass calling and emailing without the prospect showing any intent is ineffective. Today, with the explosion of data available online, intent signals\u2014such as web activity, social media interactions, and content engagement\u2014are critical for identifying leads. The challenge now is not just gathering this data but integrating and analyzing it to make your outbound effective at scale with the right messaging.\n\n2. Get Hacky with Finding Leads & Continuously Experiment:\nYou should run dozens of experiments on different lead lists and iterate until you find message-market fit. During the first month at Strac, we ran over 50 distribution experiments to find where our product had the most obvious signs of product-market fit and iterated on our outreach approach until we found message-market fit. \n\nWhen building out your ETL for sales, it\u2019s important to build a framework that\u2019s conducive to this. If you build a slow-moving, rigid outreach framework, you will limit how many experiments you can run, and your business will die. With startups, every single day you are just slowly dying\u2014iterate fast.\n\n3. Show Immediate Value to Your Customers:\nStrac was one of the most customer-obsessed companies I\u2019ve ever seen. The most important thing is to fundamentally understand what problem your customer is trying to solve, as there is likely someone else also trying to solve that problem if it's a real problem.\n\nTranslating this to structuring outreach: if you just make an ask, it's unlikely you'll get a response\u2014you\u2019re not solving any problem your customer faces and instead creating a problem for them. However, if you show someone how easily they can gain something from talking with you, you'll have a prospect excited to have a conversation. \n\nAs I transition back to the founder role, I'm excited to build tools that address these challenges and help companies accelerate their go-to-market. I will continue to work closely with Strac as they go from one to ten, and I'm excited to have them use our solutions to get there faster \ud83d\ude80",

It's kinda like how AlphaGo taught a model how to play by \"grading\" games, then learning what \"good\" moves are by comparing moves in winning vs losing games. This opens up a whole new paradigm for models, where you're not just teaching them the answer, but teaching them how to arrive at the right answer.\n\nWhat is Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT)?\nIt\u2019s a groundbreaking technique for teaching models how to reason. Think of it like AlphaGo: the model learns by being \u201cgraded\u201d on games and understanding what makes moves in winning games better than losing ones.\n\nWith RFT, prompts are like the \u201cgames\u201d and chain-of-thought reasoning is like the \u201cmoves.\u201d By evaluating the \"winning\" reasoning steps, the model learns which ones lead to better answers. This means we\u2019re not just teaching models the answers\u2014we\u2019re teaching them how to think through problems and consistently arrive at the right solutions.\n\nMy team\u2019s mission is simple: give you the world\u2019s best model for your domain.
