                                Biography
                                Arnav Adhikari is a sixth-year doctoral candidate in the Department of English. His dissertation examines the intersecting trajectories of the Cold War and decolonization in South Asia. Weaving together literary texts, documentary cinema, and political history, his project is particularly interested in the memorialization of anticolonial movements and the aesthetics of postwar socialisms. At Brown, he has taught courses on contemporary graphic novels and the global city, and has held fellowships from the Cogut Institute for the Humanities, the Saxena Center for Contemporary South Asia, and the Graduate School. His writing has appeared in
