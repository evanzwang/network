                            Comparing with conventional perpendicular magnetic recording, heat assisted magnetic recording occurs at temperatures more than twice as high in Kelvin. The ability of head field to align the medium magnetization over the short duration in recording a bit is limited by the ratio of magnetic potential energy over the thermal energy. In this paper, w...
