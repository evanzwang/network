          SPICE (Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis)
      Laurence W. Nagel and D.O. Pederson
      EECS Department, University of California, Berkeley
      Technical Report No. UCB/ERL M382
      , 1973
        [http://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/1973/ERL-m-382.pdf](http://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/1973/ERL-m-382.pdf)
      A new circuit simulation program, SPICE, is described. The simulation capabilities of nonlinear dc analysis, small signal analysis, and nonlinear transient analysis are combined in a nodal analysis program to yield a reasonably general purpose electronic circuit simulation program. Particular emphasis is placed upon the circuit models for the BJT and the FET which are implemented in SPICE.
