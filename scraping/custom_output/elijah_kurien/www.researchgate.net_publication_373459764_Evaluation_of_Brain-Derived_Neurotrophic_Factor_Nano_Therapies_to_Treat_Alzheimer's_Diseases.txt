                Abstract
                Alzheimer’s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting millions across the world. It is caused by the progressive build-up of Amyloid-β plaques and tau tangles resulting in inflammation in neurons, followed by apoptosis. This paper aims to synthesize the findings of various researchers on Alzheimer’s Diseases to shed light on a treatment using molecules that promote the survival and proliferation of neurons - neurotrophic factors. Each family of neurotrophic factors has different functions and after evaluating each one, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was shown to have the most potential in treating Alzheimer’s disease. Nano therapy was considered as a carrier for BDNF to cross the blood-brain barrier. PolyPGLA was found to be the most effective nanocarrier for BDNF.

                              More than six million Americans are living with
                              Diseases (AD) today [1]. The neurodegenerative disease, often
                              correlated with aging, develops through gradual neuronal

                              of the disease is still unknown, research has shown the importance
                              of neurotrophic factors in the survival and proliferation of neurons.
                              More recently, it has been discovered that a strong correlation
                              exists

                              Neurotrophic factors are essential proteins that help aid the
                              central nervous system in developing through promoting neuronal
                              survival, plasticity and differentiation [3]. Their levels are notably
                              high during prenatal and early developmental stages of life;
                              however, over

                              mouse models with Alzheimer’s Diseases, select few neurotrophic
                              factors have been able to treat the disease; however, many of
                              these
                              treatment applications
                              paper aims to expel all doubts by examining the progression of
                              the disease and how neurotrophic factors can be effectively used
                              as therapeutics for the disease
                              Additionally, current treatments involving neurotrophic administer
                              a
                              system and as a result, can be very expensive and dangerous [6].

                                - however, due to their degeneration they severely decrease
                                the amount of AcH found in the brain [8]. Due to the many

                                two pathways that the protein can go through, the amyloidogenic
                                and non-amyloidogenic

                                with the potential to treat AD because it interacts with the
                                receptor, which is directly correlated to a downregulation in
                                amyloid precursor protein. It also dephosphorylates tau through the

                                has been proven to be incapable of crossing the BBB and as a
                                result, alternative methods must be used to deliver the treatment.
                                A commonly used treatment for all drugs that cannot cross the
                                BBB is injecting it directly into the spinal cord, an intrathecal
                                injection [19]. This method is often very expensive, dangerous

                                                Neurotrophins promote neuronal survival and synaptic plasticity via activating the tropomyosin receptor kinases. BDNF and its high-affinity receptor TrkB are reduced in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), contributing to progressive cognitive decline. However, how the signaling mediates AD pathologies remains incompletely understood. Here we show that the TrkB receptor binds and phosphorylates APP, reducing amyloid-β production, which are abrogated by δ-secretase cleavage of TrkB in AD. Remarkably, BDNF stimulates TrkB to phosphorylate APP Y687 residue that accumulates APP in the TGN (Trans-Golgi Network) and diminishes its amyloidogenic cleavage. Delta-secretase cleaves TrkB at N365 and N486/489 residues and abolishes its neurotrophic activity, decreasing p-APP Y687 and altering its subcellular trafficking. Notably, both TrkB and APP are robustly cleaved by δ-secretase in AD brains, accompanied by mitigated TrkB signaling and reduced p-Y687. Blockade of TrkB cleavage attenuates AD pathologies in 5xFAD mice, rescuing the learning and memory. Viral expression of TrkB 1-486 fragment in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice facilitates amyloid pathology and mitigates cognitive functions. Hence, δ-secretase cleaves TrkB and blunts its phosphorylation of APP, facilitating AD pathogenesis.

                                                The link between histopathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), i.e. amyloid plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles, and AD-associated cognitive impairment, has long been established. However, the introduction of interactions between amyloid-beta (Aβ) as well as hyperphosphorylated tau, and the cholinergic system to the territory of descriptive neuropathology has drastically changed this field by adding the theory of synaptic neurotransmission to the toxic pas de deux in AD. Accumulating data show that a multitarget approach involving all amyloid, tau, and cholinergic hypotheses could better explain the evolution of events happening in AD. Various species of both Aβ and tau could be traced in cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain system early in the course of the disease. These molecules induce degeneration in the neurons of this system. Reciprocally, aberrant cholinergic system modulation promotes changes in amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism and tau phosphorylation, resulting in neurotoxicity, neuroinflammation, and neuronal death. Altogether, these changes may better correlate with the clinical findings and cognitive impairment detected in AD patients. Failure of several of Aβ- and tau-related therapies further highlights the need for special attention to molecules that target all of these mentioned pathologic changes. Another noteworthy fact here is that none of the popular hypotheses of AD such as amyloidopathy or tauopathy seem to be responsible for the changes observed in AD alone. Thus, the main culprit should be sought higher in the stream somewhere in APP metabolism or Wnt signaling in the cholinergic system of the basal forebrain. Future studies should target these pathological events.

                                                Cholinergic synapses are ubiquitous in the human central nervous system. Their high density in the thalamus, striatum, limbic system, and neocortex suggest that cholinergic transmission is likely to be critically important for memory, learning, attention and other higher brain functions. Several lines of research suggest additional roles for cholinergic systems in overall brain homeostasis and plasticity. As such, the brain's cholinergic system occupies a central role in ongoing research related to normal cognition and age-related cognitive decline, including dementias such as Alzheimer's disease. The cholinergic hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease centres on the progressive loss of limbic and neocortical cholinergic innervation. Neurofibrillary degeneration in the basal forebrain is believed to be the primary cause for the dysfunction and death of forebrain cholinergic neurons, giving rise to a widespread presynaptic cholinergic denervation. Cholinesterase inhibitors increase the availability of acetylcholine at synapses in the brain and are one of the few drug therapies that have been proven clinically useful in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease dementia, thus validating the cholinergic system as an important therapeutic target in the disease. This review includes an overview of the role of the cholinergic system in cognition and an updated understanding of how cholinergic deficits in Alzheimer's disease interact with other aspects of disease pathophysiology, including plaques composed of amyloid-β proteins. This review also documents the benefits of cholinergic therapies at various stages of Alzheimer's disease and during long-term follow-up as visualized in novel imaging studies. The weight of the evidence supports the continued value of cholinergic drugs as a standard, cornerstone pharmacological approach in Alzheimer's disease, particularly as we look ahead to future combination therapies that address symptoms as well as disease progression.

                                                Neurotrophic factors comprise essential secreted proteins that have several functions in neural and non-neural tissues, mediating the development, survival and maintenance of peripheral and central nervous system. Therefore, neurotrophic factor issue has been extensively investigated into the context of neurodegenerative diseases. Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease show changes in the regulation of specific neurotrophic factors and their receptors, which appear to be critical for neuronal degeneration. Indeed, neurotrophic factors prevent cell death in degenerative processes and can enhance the growth and function of affected neurons in these disorders. Based on recent reports, this review discusses the main findings related to the neurotrophic factor support – mainly brain-derived neurotrophic factor and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor – in the survival, proliferation and maturation of affected neurons in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease as well as their putative application as new therapeutic approach for these diseases management.

                                                Introduction: 
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been implicated in wide range of neurological diseases and injury. This neurotrophic factor is vital for neuronal health, survival, and synaptic connectivity. Many therapies focus on the restoration or enhancement of BDNF following injury or disease progression. Areas Covered: The present review will focus on the mechanisms in which BDNF exerts its beneficial functioning, current BDNF therapies, issues and potential solutions for delivery of neurotrophic factors to the central nervous system, and other disease indications that may benefit from overexpression or restoration of BDNF. Expert Opinion: Due to the role of BDNF in neuronal development, maturation, and health, BDNF is implicated in numerous neurological diseases making it a prime therapeutic agent. Numerous studies have shown the therapeutic potential of BDNF in a number of neurodegenerative disease models and in acute CNS injury, however clinical translation has fallen short due to issues in delivering this molecule. The use of MSC as a delivery platform for BDNF holds great promise for clinical advancement of neurotrophic factor restoration. The ease with which MSC can be engineered opens the door to the possibility of using this cell-based delivery system to advance a BDNF therapy to the clinic.

                                                Neurodegenerative causes of blindness and deafness possess a major challenge in their clinical management as proper treatment guidelines have not yet been found. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been established as a promising therapy against neurodegenerative disorders including hearing and visual loss. Unfortunately, the blood–retinal barrier and blood–cochlear barrier, which have a comparable structure to the blood–brain barrier prevent molecules of larger sizes (such as BDNF) from exiting the circulation and reaching the targeted cells. Anatomical features of the eye and ear allow use of local administration, bypassing histo-hematic barriers. This paper focuses on highlighting a variety of strategies proposed for the local administration of the BDNF, like direct delivery, viral gene therapy, and cell-based therapy, which have been shown to successfully improve development, survival, and function of spiral and retinal ganglion cells. The similarities and controversies for BDNF treatment of posterior eye diseases and inner ear diseases have been analyzed and compared. In this review, we also focus on the possibility of translation of this knowledge into clinical practice. And finally, we suggest that using nanoparticulate drug-delivery systems may substantially contribute to the development of clinically viable techniques for BDNF delivery into the cochlea or posterior eye segment, which, ultimately, can lead to a long-term or permanent rescue of auditory and optic neurons from degeneration.

                                                Acetylcholinesterase is involved in the termination of impulse transmission by rapid hydrolysis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine in numerous cholinergic pathways in the central and peripheral nervous systems. The enzyme inactivation, induced by various inhibitors, leads to acetylcholine accumulation, hyperstimulation of nicotinic and muscarinic receptors, and disrupted neurotransmission. Hence, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, interacting with the enzyme as their primary target, are applied as relevant drugs and toxins. This review presents an overview of toxicology and pharmacology of reversible and irreversible acetylcholinesterase inactivating compounds. In the case of reversible inhibitors being commonly applied in neurodegenerative disorders treatment, special attention is paid to currently approved drugs (donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine) in the pharmacotherapy of Alzheimer's disease, and toxic carbamates used as pesticides. Subsequently, mechanism of irreversible acetylcholinesterase inhibition induced by organophosphorus compounds (insecticides and nerve agents), and their specific and nonspecific toxic effects are described, as well as irreversible inhibitors having pharmacological implementation. In addition, the pharmacological treatment of intoxication caused by organophosphates is presented, with emphasis on oxime reactivators of the inhibited enzyme activity administering as causal drugs after the poisoning. Besides, organophosphorus and carbamate insecticides can be detoxified in mammals through enzymatic hydrolysis before they reach targets in the nervous system. Carboxylesterases most effectively decompose carbamates, whereas the most successful route of organophosphates detoxification is their degradation by corresponding phosphotriesterases.

                                                The physiological role of the neurotrophin nerve growth factor (NGF) has been characterized, since its discovery in the 1950s, first in the sensory and autonomic nervous system, then in central nervous, endocrine and immune systems. NGF plays its trophic role both during development and in adulthood, ensuring the maintenance of phenotypic and functional characteristic of several populations of neurons as well as immune cells. From a translational standpoint, the action of NGF on cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain and on sensory neurons in dorsal root ganglia first gained researcher's attention, in view of possible clinical use in Alzheimer's disease patients and in peripheral neuropathies respectively. The translational and clinical research on NGF have, since then, enlarged the spectrum of diseases that could benefit from NGF treatment, at the same time highlighting possible limitations in the use of the neurotrophin as a drug. In this review we give a comprehensive account for almost all of the clinical trials attempted until now by using NGF. A perspective on future development for translational research on NGF is also discussed, in view of recent proposals for innovative delivery strategies and/or for additional pathologies to be treated, such as ocular and skin diseases, gliomas, traumatic brain injuries, vascular and immune diseases.

                                                Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a dominant neurotrophic factor in the brain which plays a crucial role in differentiation, regeneration and plasticity mechanisms. Binding of the BDNF to its high-affinity tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) receptor leads to phosphorylation of TrkB, thus activating the three important downstream intracellular signaling cascades within the neural cells including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT), phospholipase C-γ (PLCγ), and mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal related kinase (MAPK/ERK) pathways. Transcription of these pathways is regulated by cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) transcription factor, which can upregulate gene expression. In this review, we attempted to explore the role of BDNF and its associated pathways in susceptibility to Schizophrenia (Scz), Alzheimer's (AD), and Parkinson's (PD) diseases. Furthermore, we discuss dysfunction in BDNF signaling pathway and the therapeutic potential of BDNF in the treatment of these disorders. The review covers various therapeutic strategies including BDNF gene therapy, transplantation of BDNF-expressing cell grafts, epigenetic manipulation, and intraparenchymal BDNF protein infusion as well. This review seeks to achieve these goals by reviewing recent studies on BDNF and examining the details of BDNF pathway in any of the above-mentioned diseases.

                          The role of neurotrophic factors has been highlighted as a cause of decline in the cognitive function of alcohol-dependent patients. It is known that nerve-growth factor (NGF), one of the neurotrophins, is related to the growth and differentiation of nerve cells, as well as to a decline in cognitive function. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between decreased NGF
                            levels and cognitive decline in alcohol-dependent patients. The serum concentration of NGF was measured in 38 patients with chronic alcohol dependence, and several neuropsychological tests were also performed for cognitive function assessment. The results indicated a significant correlation between serum NGF level and the trail-making test part B, which evaluates executive function, but did not show a significant correlation with other cognitive function tests. An increased serum level of NGF was associated with a decreased completion time in the trail-making test B, and this finding indicates that a high serum level of NGF is related to greater executive function. This finding may imply a protective role of NGF in preventing neuron damage among patients with alcohol dependence. Larger controlled studies will be necessary in the future to investigate this issue further.

                          Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is identified by the gradual decline in memory and cognitive function. It is classified by the deposition of Aβ plaques, the build-up of intracellular neurofibrillary tangle and neuron loss. Neurotrophic factors play critical role in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. However, the utilization of such neurotrophins has
                            encountered certain difficulties and side effects. Novel technological advancements prioritize innovative dipeptides usage, which offer fewer side effects. The present study endeavors to analyze the compound hexamethylenediamide bis-(N-monosuccinyl-glutamyl-lysine) (Lab name: H-MGL), a newly discovered neurotrophin mimetic dipeptide, with the aim of alleviating memory impairment in an intracerebroventricular single dose streptozotocin (STZ)-induced Alzheimer model in rats. We arranged 4 groups consist of sham, groups receiving STZ and STZ+H-MGL (1 and 2mg/kg). The H-MGL was administered consecutively for 14 days following STZ injection subsequently, the Morris Water Maze test was performed. The findings suggest that administration of STZ caused significantly increment in mean escape latency and mean traveled distance in acquisition days. H-MGL at a dosage of 1mg/kg failed to yield any notable improvement in rats when compared to STZ. By contrast, a dosage of 2mg/kg of H-MGL led to a significant decrease in the latency to first platform crossing and frequency of platform crossings. Consequently, the aforementioned findings have engendered the notion that H-MGL partially ameliorate cognitive impairment so it may hold promise for having low side effects to alleviate cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease, or potentially decreases the symptoms associated with its progression.
