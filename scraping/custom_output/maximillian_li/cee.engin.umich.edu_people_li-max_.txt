        Biography
          Max is an Assistant Professor of Aerospace Engineering (starting August 2022) at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, with a 0% appointment in Industrial and Operations Engineering. Max received his PhD in Aerospace Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2021. He earned his MSE in Systems Engineering and BSE in Electrical Engineering and Mathematics, both from the University of Pennsylvania, in 2018. Broadly, he is interested in the analysis, control, and optimization of networks and networked processes, signal processing over irregular domains and manifolds, and geometric/topological data analysis, with an eye towards applications in air transportation systems and other societal-scale networks. Max is the recipient of the Federal Aviation Administration RAISE Award (2018), a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship (2018), and the Wellington and Irene Loh Fellowship from MIT (2019), as well as several best paper awards from ICRAT and the ATM R&D Seminar, two joint FAA-Eurocontrol conferences.
