                          How we measure 'reads'
                        A 'read' is counted each time someone views a publication summary (such as the title, abstract, and list of authors), clicks on a figure, or views or downloads the full-text.

                            A C2-symmetric chiral spirocyclic diol aza-SPINOL containing a spirooxindole scaffold has been designed, synthesized, and optically resolved. The product could be synthesized on gram scale in an overall yield of 22%. Moreover, elaborations of aza-SPINOL to other chiral ligands as well as the preliminary investigation of the related bisphosphine lig...

                            A ruthenium(II)‐catalyzed asymmetric intramolecular hydroarylation assisted by a chiral transient directing group has been developed. A series of 2,3‐dihydrobenzofurans bearing chiral all‐carbon quaternary stereocenters have been prepared in remarkably high yields (up to 98 %) and enantioselectivities (up to >99 % ee). By this methodology, a novel...
