          <p>Since our inception, our members have been striving to apply their skills in Artificial Intelligence to help solve the real problems in communities around us. Our student teams work with nonprofits, researchers, and community leaders on semester-long projects to ensure that new advancements in AI are used for social good.  At the moment, our projects are primarily centered around machine learning, a subfield of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on leveraging large amounts of data to build statistical models that are able to generate insights and predictions that traditional software can’t.</p>
