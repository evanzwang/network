                        Dr Datta was so helpful and help me to understand what the issue is with my blood situation.
                        Oct 09, 2024
                        Excellent communicator and explained things in a way that I could understand.

                        Wonderful care with Dr. Datta
                        Aug 30, 2024
                        Dr. Datta is so wonderful.  I felt fortunate to meet with him to discuss my health issue. He is such a good listener with a pleasant manner.
                        Aug 14, 2024
                        Dr. Datta was one of the most patient-centered and genuinely friendly and care medical doctors I've ever had, and I've seen many. I felt very respected, and I appreciated his starting off by asking me about myself more broadly as a person. Really impressive! His medical knowledge and care were also excellent, and the holistic approach engendered trust.
                        Jun 18, 2024
                        This was a first visit. I felt confident that I was in good hands.
                        Jun 17, 2024
                        Excellent
                        May 28, 2024
                        Dr Datta listened by to my concerns and took them seriously.  He patiently answered my questions and explained things very clearly.  He is warm, kind, extremely knowledgeable, and was thorough in the evaluation.  I have complete confidence in his judgment.  He is the finest doctor I have met at UCSF.
                        May 24, 2024
                        Excellent care
                        May 10, 2024
                        Dr. Datta is an excellent doctor!
                        The doctor was so kind and knowledgeable and great at explaining information!!  Very professional and knowledgeable and patient with my questions!!
                        Apr 19, 2024
                        Dr Datta id one of the best if not the best Dr's I've ever had. He's thorough, knowledgable, caring, and informative.
                        Apr 16, 2024
                        Dr. Data was very pleasant and easy to talk to.
                        Apr 15, 2024
                        Dr Datta is an exceptional doctor and gave me excellent care.  I would rank him "outstanding" on all of the above.
                        Dec 15, 2023
                        Amazing Provider
                        Dec 09, 2023
                        Dr did not just listen he "heard" what I was trying to say
                        Nov 12, 2023
                        He is a great doctor who you can have discussions with. He takes the time prior to visit to look up and re-familiarize himself with past tests, etc. Really happy with Dr. Datta MD
                        Oct 04, 2023
                        He is wonderful
                        Sep 17, 2023
                        Excellent Doctor
                        Sep 16, 2023
                        Dr Datta answered all my questions clearly. In addition, he provided a clear answer to two questions which I had asked other doctors in the past and had never received a clear, definitive answer. Dr Datta was knowledgeable enough to provide that clear answer.
                        Aug 29, 2023
                        The best consultation I've ever had with the Face to Face portal
                        Aug 26, 2023
                        Dr. Datta interpreted and explained the results of my lab work and tests in a way that I was able to understand.  He answered all my questions.  I was Involved In creating  came a follow up plan.  I appreciated his patience.  I didn't feel he was rushed to end my visit.
                        Aug 04, 2023
                        The doctor was very personable and intelligent. He clearly explained the risks and benefits of taking blood thinners, and the information was helpful.
                        Jul 26, 2023
                        Dr. D was so considerate and thorough with my case. I deeply appreciated his expertise and empathetic bedside manner.
                        Jun 14, 2023
                        This was for a second opinion, so probably will not be having any follow up appointments.
                        May 19, 2023
                        Dr. Datta is simply an amazing human being and doctor.  We never feel rushed. He always gives us 100% attention and really listens to our concerns, ideas, and thoughts.  We are very grateful to have him in our lives.  Being able to do a televisit is critical since we live three hours away.
                        Apr 09, 2023
                        Extraordinary doctor. He really cares.
                        Apr 04, 2023
                        My supplier was tirelessly good at his job
                        Mar 31, 2023
                        Dr.Datta is very very kind. He listens very well,explains in a way I understand and helps in every way.
                        Mar 24, 2023
                        I appreciated that when Dr. Datta came in the room the first thing he asked was to learn a little about me as a person. I have never had a doctor do that before and I thought that was a very kind and caring thing to do.
                        Feel confident that things are going to go well!
