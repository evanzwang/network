                            Prospective graduate students
                            should apply directly to the
                            [Department of Chemical Engineering](https://cheme.stanford.edu/admissions/phd-overview)
                            at Stanford University.
                            Current Stanford graduate and undergraduate students
                            should contact Prof. Mai by e-mail with a résumé (1 page) and brief statement of interest (<500 words). Undergraduate students are also encouraged to apply to the
                            [Chemical Engineering Research Experience for Undergraduates](https://ughb.stanford.edu/jobs-opportunities/research-experience-undergraduates)
                            (apply during Winter quarter). Need help with a résumé? Explore resources at
                            [Stanford BEAM](https://beam.stanford.edu/)

                            Non-Stanford undergraduate and high school students
                            should seek centralized programs to conduct research on campus and indicate their interest in the Mai Lab. For equity reasons, the Mai Lab does not host ad hoc students. Currently, the lab hosts students through the
                            [Stanford Engineering Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF)](https://engineering.stanford.edu/students-academics/equity-and-inclusion-initiatives/prospective-graduate-programs/summer)
                            and the
                            [Chinese Undergraduate Visiting Research Program](https://engineering.stanford.edu/students-academics/programs/global-engineering-programs/chinese-ugvr)
                            Postdoctoral candidates
                            should contact Prof. Mai by e-mail with a cover letter on institutional letterhead, 1-page summary of research experience and interests, CV, and up to three publication p/reprints. Incomplete applications will not be considered.
