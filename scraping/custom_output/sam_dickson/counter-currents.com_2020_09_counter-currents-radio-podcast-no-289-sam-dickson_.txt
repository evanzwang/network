                          It’s always a treat to listen to what one of our great conversationalists Mr. Dickson has to say on current affairs. I wish he had a weekly podcast.
                          Has there been any attempt to bring Wilmot Robertson’s The Dispossessed Majority back to print?

                          When Bill Clinton and his wife first slithered onto the national stage almost 30 years ago now, we should have known our republic’s days were numbered.

                                Exactly correct, I was barely 20 at that time but I knew the country was done after Clinton was elected. During that campaign I donated to Pat Buchanan which was my first and last political campaign contribution.

                          I enjoy Sam Dickson very much but I think he is a bit hard on Thomas Jefferson.  Yes, I wish Jefferson had left that phrase “All Men are created equal” out of the Declaration.  But he could not see how it would come to be interpreted.  In a video about Jefferson, Jared Taylor makes the point that Jefferson actually meant that the colonists in America and the British citizens living in England are equal.  In his “Notes on the State of Virginia”, Jefferson makes quite clear that he is a race realist and the white race and the black race are not equal.

                          In addition to those books recommended by Mr. Dickson, I would add: The Wartime Journals of Charles Lindbergh. Especially beneficial for confused young people on the fence.
                          This book provides a visceral, realtime account of the people and events of 1937-45, which can help us all understand why things “are what they are” today – and who we can thank for the current calamity.
                          I first read the book when it was published in 1970. It helped me understand many things, and provided a starting-point for further research.
                            K.k.

                          Fantastic interview. Looking forward to the mentioned forthcoming interviews about some of the great figures Sam has known.

                          I thought this was a good historical review.  I would like to hear more from Dickson.  Great podcast series!  Two issues:
                          1) I object to any injunctions against kooks and marginal persons.  If I cannot be accepted among you guys, then where?
                          2) is it kwik-sotic or I thought ki-hotic, as in the Quixote?

                          Great stuff!
                          Sam Dickson really needs to do more interviews and videos. He combines the experience of a lifetime in the movement with solid analysis and a folksy but incisive speaking style.
                          One useful thing would be a series in which Sam provides an informal course in activism, especially from the legal angle.

                          Sam is right about European peoples needing to get real about donations. We need to support content creators and our political activists much more.

                          An engaging interview, but Henry VIII’s seizure of the monasteries is nothing to admire.  An upstart Tudor destroyed the spiritual heart of his nation so he could buy the loyalty of an upstart crony aristocracy made up of men like Cromwell.  This was the beginning of England’s decline into a spiritually enervated nation of shopkeepers utterly subservient to a self-serving ruling class.

                          I recall reading in Instauration about Sam Dixon running for office in Georgia so great to actually hear his voice after all these years. He’s very much in the Wilmot  Robertson mould — urbane, articulate and immensely knowledgeable. The very best of old America. I hope you can arrange further interviews especially about his reflections on the important Rightists he’s worked with over his long career.

                          So great to finally hear from Sam. I often wonder what he thinks of things.

                          We need Sam to talk in detail about both Wilmot Robertson and Revilo Oliver, – in detail – and to talk about their differences too.
