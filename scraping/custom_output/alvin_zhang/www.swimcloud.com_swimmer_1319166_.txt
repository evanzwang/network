                          Regroup highlits by Year
                          We want all highlights from the same day to be ordered by their class type
                          Thats why we first sort them by child_class and then by date_awarded
                          This leads to (date_awarded, class_name) sort.

                          2025
                          Now we want to group highlits by type, e.g. Meet,Athletic,Academic
                          We do this to render each group in a own way
                          Define specific render for MeetHighlight
                          We can have records from several meets in a MeetHighlight Class
                          Thats why we sort all the highlights by meet_id
                          And then group my meet, to get all records from a meet.
                          meet_group contains all highlights per meet.
                          To keep the correct meet order, we sort the meets by startdate
                            Feb 19
                            Now we want to group highlights per htype (champion/finalist).
