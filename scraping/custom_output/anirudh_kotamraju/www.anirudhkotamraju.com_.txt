      Hey! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Anirudh.
      Iâ€™m an undergraduate studying Computer Science at UC Berkeley. I love
          working on challenging computational problems and building elegant
          software.
      Most of my experience has been in machine learning, full stack web
          development, and security, but Iâ€™m always eager to explore new areas
          of computing.
      Currently, Iâ€™m doing research at the UC Berkeley Space Sciences Lab,
          where Iâ€™m developing deep learning models for Compton telescope image
          generation.
      Previously, Iâ€™ve worked on full stack development at Amazon, automated
          cyberattack detection at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, cloud
          infrastructure at One Convergence, and computational astrophysics at
          UC Santa Cruz.
