            Building a community of problem solvers with intelligent software
            Mission
            We believe young engineers have great potential to tackle problems with machine learning. To take part in this fast growing movement of advancing intelligent software, we build a community of passionate students who have brilliant skills and ideas as well as a desire to learn about artificial intelligence.

          As a community, we embody ideals that foster an inclusive and welcoming environment for engineers.
              Craft
              We value not only past experience, but also intuition and the ability to think strategically.
              Dedication
              Members are chosen because they have demonstrated an incredible work ethic.
              Integrity
