          [EE-gor bah-rah-KAH-yev]
            Most recently, Iâ€™ve been working on
              [Imaginara](https://imaginara.ink)
              and
              [Memory+](https://memory.plus)
              with David Eagleman.
            Before that, I worked on consolidating data pipelines at
              [Bloomberg Indices](https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/products/bloomberg-terminal/)
              , distributing coding tasks to remote engineers at
              [GitStart](https://gitstart.com)
              (YC-backed), processing content for trust & safety at
              [Cove](https://getcove.com/)
              (Neo-backed), and building the infrastructure for pricing a significant portion of the German car insurance market at
              [QuantCo](https://quantco.com)
              .
