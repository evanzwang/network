                      Chairman at Cypher Capital
                      Speaker
                      Profile
                          Bill Qian brings a wealth of experience and a proven track record in the cryptocurrency and fintech sectors.
                          As the former Global Head of M&A and Binance Labs at Binance, he managed the world’s largest cryptocurrency portfolio at the time, valued at $20 billion.
                          Currently, Bill serves as the Managing Director and Chief Investment Officer of Phoenix Group (ADX: PHX) and as Chairman of Cypher Capital.
                          In 2022, Phoenix Group became the first cryptocurrency company to assist a sovereign entity in establishing its strategic Bitcoin reserve. Phoenix is also the first cryptocurrency company to go public in the Middle East, backed by sovereign investors from Abu Dhabi.
                          The group operates three core business units:
                          • Phoenix Mining, the largest Bitcoin mining operation in the Middle East.
                          • M2.com, a leading regulated cryptocurrency exchange licensed in Abu Dhabi.
                          • Cypher Capital, a prominent multi-strategy investment firm that has supported over 140 top-tier global projects, including Solana, Mysten Labs (Sui), Ton, Sei, and Bouncebit.
                          Before joining Phoenix, Bill was the Head of Investment for Fintech and Technology at JD.com, a leading Asian internet platform generating over $400 billion in annual gross merchandise volume.
                          Throughout his career, Bill has deployed and managed over $30 billion in investments across AI, cryptocurrency, and fintech, driving transformative innovation across multiple industries.
                          With his visionary leadership and strategic insight, Bill continues to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of technology and innovation on a global scale.
