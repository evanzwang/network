                There are plenty of posts about confectionery on
                  , as there's a massive demand for sweet news. Some use cakes as a part of some

                  , and some create cool desserts that are just
                  [plain creepy](../scary-cakes-guymeetscake-andrew-fuller/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=organic)
                  . No matter the preference, in baking, like in real cake, there are layers of hierarchy: only a select few become the creme de la creme, cream of the crop, top of the food chain, the icing on the cake. Ben Cullen, 28, is one of them. His cake designs have a stunning range—from something that looks like it came from a fast-food diner to edible clothes, to stylized-yet-lifelike busts, to stabs at horror movies, to vegetables and optical illusions—he can do it all, it seems. His edible art messes with your brain, too! Some of his eye tricks look better on the outside than on the inside, and some the other way around. Some things seem so delicious that you don't care what they'd actually taste like, and some you wouldn't approach from miles away (they're still probably delicious, though.) In any case, check his food art out and see for yourself. If you felt a sugar rush and you're hooked, check out his Instagram and Facebook to see even more. Who knew that the term "eye candy" could be so figuratively literal? Have a nice one.

                  Fascinated by music, movies and sitcoms, I'm passionate about social media and can't live without the internet, especially for all the cute dog and cat pictures out there. I wish the day had about 40 hours to be able to do everything I want.

                      These are incredible. I wouldn't be able to eat many of these, though, when I eat a dessert I want it to look like a dessert

                      All of these are AWESOME! Some are also really, really disturbing.
As somebody who prefers savory food, I might actually get a little mad if my curry with rice turned out to be cake. 😅
