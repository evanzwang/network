          <h3>Current Research and Scholarly Interests</h3>
          <p>1. Multimodal optical imaging of bladder cancer<br /><br />A major focus of my lab is to develop enhanced endoscopic imaging technologies (e.g. fluorescence, endomicroscopy, molecular imaging, computer vision, and artificial intelligence) to improve bladder tumor detection and resection.   We have investigated CD47, an innate immune checkpoint, as a bladder cancer imaging and therapeutic target.  We identified and validated CD47 as a promising cancer imaging target and proposed a strategy for intravesical administration of imaging agents based on therapeutic antibodies (Pan 2014).  In animal models, we investigated the biodistribution and systemic toxicity of nanoparticle-labeled anti-CD47 (Pan 2017) and demonstrated that CD47-mediated near-infrared photoimmunotherapy, a novel form of targeted phototherapy, led to enhanced tumor destruction and prolonged survival (Kiss 2019).  In the clinical arena, we pioneered the urological applications of confocal endomicroscopy for bladder cancer (Sonn 2009), upper tract urothelial carcinoma (Bui 2015) and prostate cancer (Lopez 2015).  This optical biopsy technology enables real-time intraoperative imaging with spatial resolution comparable to histology.  Finally, we are developing computer vision and artificial intelligence tools to enhance cystoscopic navigation and tumor identification.  We have an ongoing effort to curate a high quality annotated cystoscopy imaging dataset of diverse bladder cancer variants and recently reported the first AI-assisted cystoscopy using convolutional neural networks for automated tumor annotation (Shkolyar 2019).<br /><br /><br />2. Precision diagnostics for bladder cancer <br /><br />Another major focus is identification and validation of urine-based biomarkers to inform bladder cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment response.  Given its abundance and non-invasive nature of sample collection, urine serves as an ideal source of liquid biopsy.  To overcome the diagnostic shortcomings of standard urine cytology, we have utilized high throughput sequencing technology as a discovery and diagnostic tool.  We applied bulk RNA sequencing to urinary pellets for biomarker discovery and developed a diagnostic 3-marker urinary RNA panel (Sin 2017), and led a multi-center effort to validate another urinary RNA panel using an integrated microfluidic cartridge (Wallace 2019).  Collaboratively with other colleagues at Stanford, we are developing an ultrasensitive targeted sequencing approach called uCAPP-Seq (urine tumor DNA Cancer Personalized Profiling by deep sequencing) for bladder cancer (Dudley 2019) and have started prospective longitudinal validation studies of these precision diagnostic platforms.<br /><br /><br />3. Precision diagnostics of urinary tract infections <br /><br />A longstanding focus of my lab has been the development of molecular diagnostics for bacterial infections to direct evidence-based utilization of antibiotics and curtail the proliferation of multidrug resistant pathogens.  We focus on urinary tract infections, the most common urological disease and healthcare-associated infection.  We have made broad advances in molecular probe development for amplification-free bacterial detection, microfluidic-based antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST), sample preparation strategies compatible with matrix effects from clinical samples, system integration, and single cell analysis.  Representative works include rapid, sensitive pathogen identification through 16S rRNA targeting (Ouyang 2013, Mach 2019), validation of integrated AST in clinical samples (Altobelli 2016), and single cell analysis (Hsieh 2018, Li 2019).  Most recently, we report a 30-minute sample-to-answer assay based on single-cell measurements of bacterial 16S rRNA in picoliter droplets to achieve simultaneous molecular pathogen identification and phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility assessment (Kaushik 2021).</p>

In this study, we evaluate the feasibility of real-time AI integration during clinic cystoscopy and transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) on live, streaming video.Patients undergoing clinic flexible cystoscopy and TURBT were prospectively enrolled.

Streaming videos were processed in real time to display alert boxes in sync with live cystoscopy. The per-frame diagnostic accuracy was measured.Real-time CystoNet was successfully integrated in the operating room during TURBT and clinic cystoscopy in 50 consecutive patients. There were 55 procedures that met the inclusion criteria for analysis including 21 clinic cystoscopies and 34 TURBTs. For clinic cystoscopy, real-time CystoNet achieved per-frame tumor specificity of 98.8% with a median error rate of 3.6% (range: 0 - 47%) frames per cystoscopy. For TURBT, the per-frame tumor sensitivity was 52.9% and the per-frame tumor specificity was 95.4% with an error rate of 16.7% for cases with pathologically confirmed bladder cancers.The current pilot study demonstrates the feasibility of using a real-time AI system (real-time CystoNet) during cystoscopy and TURBT to generate active feedback to the surgeon.

Up to 30% of patients with residual fragments &lt;2 mm in size experience subsequent stone-related complications. Here we demonstrate a stone retrieval technology in which fragments are rendered magnetizable with a magnetic hydrogel so that they can be easily retrieved with a simple magnetic tool. The magnetic hydrogel facilitates robust in vitro capture of stone fragments of clinically relevant sizes and compositions. The hydrogel components exhibit no cytotoxicity in cell culture and only superficial effects on ex vivo human urothelium and in vivo mouse bladders. Furthermore, the hydrogel demonstrates antimicrobial activity against common uropathogens on par with that of common antibiotics. By enabling the efficient retrieval of kidney stone fragments, our method can lead to improved stone-free rates and patient outcomes.&#34;},{&#34;apaCitation&#34;:&#34;Li, H., Hsieh, K., Wong, P.

In patients who underwent transurethral resection of bladder tumor, urine samples were categorized based on tumor histopathology, size, and focality. Subjects with intermediate and high-risk BCa based on American Urological Association (AUA) guideline for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer were classified as \&#34;increased-risk\&#34;; those with no cancer and AUA low-risk BCa were classified as \&#34;low-risk\&#34;.

CD47 is an innate immune checkpoint widely expressed on bladder cancer cells but absent from luminal normal urothelium.

Phagocytosis assays were performed to evaluate macrophage activity after NIR-PIT. Anti-CD47-IR700 was administered to murine xenograft tumor models of human bladder cancer for in vivo molecular imaging and NIR-PIT.RESULTS: Cytotoxicity in cell lines and primary bladder cancer cells significantly increased in a light-dose dependent manner with CD47-targeted NIR-PIT. Phagocytosis of cancer cells significantly increased with NIR-PIT compared to antibody alone (p=0.0002). In vivo fluorescence intensity of anti-CD47-IR700 in tumors reached a peak 24-hour post injection and was detectable for at least 14 days. After a single round of CD47-targeted NIR-PIT, treated animals showed significantly slower tumor growth compared to controls (p&lt;0.0001). Repeated CD47-targeted NIR-PIT treatment further slowed tumor growth (p=0.0104) and improved survival compared to controls.CONCLUSION: CD47-targeted NIR-PIT increased direct cancer cell death and phagocytosis resulting in inhibited tumor growth and improved survival in a murine xenograft model of human bladder cancer.&lt;/p>\n  &lt;p class=\&#34;pub-med\&#34;>\n    &lt;span>View details for &lt;a href=\&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30890547\&#34;>PubMedID 30890547&lt;/a>&lt;/span>\n  &lt;/p>&#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;Abstract:\nPURPOSE: Near-infrared photoimmunotherapy (NIR-PIT) is a localized molecular cancer therapy combining a photosensitizer-conjugated monoclonal antibody and light energy.

CD47 is an innate immune checkpoint widely expressed on bladder cancer cells but absent from luminal normal urothelium. Targeting CD47 for NIR-PIT has the potential to selectively induce cancer cell death and minimize damage to normal urothelium.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The cytotoxic effect of NIR-PIT with anti-CD47-IR700 was investigated in human bladder cancer cell lines and primary human bladder cancer cells derived from fresh surgical samples. Phagocytosis assays were performed to evaluate macrophage activity after NIR-PIT. Anti-CD47-IR700 was administered to murine xenograft tumor models of human bladder cancer for in vivo molecular imaging and NIR-PIT.RESULTS: Cytotoxicity in cell lines and primary bladder cancer cells significantly increased in a light-dose dependent manner with CD47-targeted NIR-PIT. Phagocytosis of cancer cells significantly increased with NIR-PIT compared to antibody alone (p=0.0002). In vivo fluorescence intensity of anti-CD47-IR700 in tumors reached a peak 24-hour post injection and was detectable for at least 14 days. After a single round of CD47-targeted NIR-PIT, treated animals showed significantly slower tumor growth compared to controls (p&lt;0.0001). Repeated CD47-targeted NIR-PIT treatment further slowed tumor growth (p=0.0104) and improved survival compared to controls.CONCLUSION: CD47-targeted NIR-PIT increased direct cancer cell death and phagocytosis resulting in inhibited tumor growth and improved survival in a murine xenograft model of human bladder cancer.&#34;},{&#34;apaCitation&#34;:&#34;Shkolyar, E., Jia, X., Chang, T.

Bladder cancer is primarily managed endoscopically by white light cystoscopy with suboptimal diagnostic accuracy.

However, traditional microbial profiling methods face limitations in processing time, measurement of absolute abundance, detection of low biomass, discrimination between live and dead cells, and functional analysis. This study introduces a rapid multimodal microbial characterization platform, Multimodal Biosensors for Transversal Analysis (MBioTA), for capturing the taxonomy, viability, and functional genes of the microbiota. The platform incorporates single cell biosensors, scalable microwell arrays, and automated image processing for rapid transversal analysis in as few as 2 h.

However, optimizing schematic documentation techniques for bladder lesions has received limited attention.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective observational study used a cMDX-based documentation system that facilitates graphical representation, a lesion-specific questionnaire, and heatmap analysis with a posterization effect. We designed a graphical scheme for bladder covering bladder landmarks to visualize anatomic features and to document the lesion location. The lesion-specific questionnaire was integrated for comprehensive lesion characterization. Finally, spatial analyses were applied to investigate the anatomic distribution patterns of bladder lesions.RESULTS: A total of 97 TURBT cases conducted between 2021 and 2023 were included, identifying 176 lesions. The lesions were distributed in different bladder areas with varying frequencies. The distribution pattern, sorted by frequency, was observed in the following areas: posterior, trigone, lateral right and anterior, and lateral left and dome. Suspicious levels were assigned to the lesions, mostly categorized either as indeterminate or moderate. Lesion size analysis revealed that most lesions fell between 5 and 29 mm.CONCLUSION: The study highlights the potential of schematic documentation techniques for informed decision making, quality assessment, primary research, and secondary data utilization of intraoperative data in the context of TURBT.

However, optimizing schematic documentation techniques for bladder lesions has received limited attention.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective observational study used a cMDX-based documentation system that facilitates graphical representation, a lesion-specific questionnaire, and heatmap analysis with a posterization effect. We designed a graphical scheme for bladder covering bladder landmarks to visualize anatomic features and to document the lesion location. The lesion-specific questionnaire was integrated for comprehensive lesion characterization. Finally, spatial analyses were applied to investigate the anatomic distribution patterns of bladder lesions.RESULTS: A total of 97 TURBT cases conducted between 2021 and 2023 were included, identifying 176 lesions. The lesions were distributed in different bladder areas with varying frequencies. The distribution pattern, sorted by frequency, was observed in the following areas: posterior, trigone, lateral right and anterior, and lateral left and dome. Suspicious levels were assigned to the lesions, mostly categorized either as indeterminate or moderate. Lesion size analysis revealed that most lesions fell between 5 and 29 mm.CONCLUSION: The study highlights the potential of schematic documentation techniques for informed decision making, quality assessment, primary research, and secondary data utilization of intraoperative data in the context of TURBT. Integrating cMDX and heatmap analysis provides valuable insights into lesion distribution and characteristics.&#34;},{&#34;apaCitation&#34;:&#34;Frydenlund, N., Meeks, J.

A polyp-directed soft pseudo-labeling (PDSPL) mechanism was proposed to generate high-quality pseudo labels and eliminate the dilution of lesion features caused by mixup operations.

Using a dual double-stranded locked nucleic acid (LNA) nanobiosensor that tracks long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) dynamics in live single cells, we monitored the spatiotemporal distribution of lncRNA during collective cancer invasion. We show that the lncRNA MALAT1 (metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1) is dynamically regulated in the invading fronts of cancer cells and patient-derived spheroids. MALAT1 transcripts exhibit distinct abundance, diffusivity, and distribution between leader and follower cells. MALAT1 expression increases when a cancer cell becomes a leader and decreases when the collective migration process stops. Transient knockdown of MALAT1 prevents the formation of leader cells and abolishes the invasion of cancer cells.

We show that the lncRNA MALAT1 (metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1) is dynamically regulated in the invading fronts of cancer cells and patient-derived spheroids. MALAT1 transcripts exhibit distinct abundance, diffusivity, and distribution between leader and follower cells. MALAT1 expression increases when a cancer cell becomes a leader and decreases when the collective migration process stops. Transient knockdown of MALAT1 prevents the formation of leader cells and abolishes the invasion of cancer cells. Taken together, our single-cell analysis suggests that MALAT1 is dynamically regulated in leader cells during collective cancer invasion.\nDOI: 10.1073/pnas.2305410120, https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2305410120\n\nPubMedID: 37364126, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37364126&#34;,&#34;value&#34;:null},&#34;doiId&#34;:&#34;10.1073/pnas.2305410120&#34;,&#34;doiUrl&#34;:&#34;https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2305410120&#34;,&#34;featured&#34;:false,&#34;firstPublished&#34;:{&#34;html&#34;:&#34;Jul 4, 2023 00:00:00 AM&#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;Jul 4, 2023 00:00:00 AM&#34;,&#34;value&#34;:&#34;2023-07-04T00:00:00.000-07:00&#34;},&#34;mlaCitation&#34;:&#34;Zhu, Ninghao et al. “Long Noncoding RNA MALAT1 Is Dynamically Regulated in Leader Cells during Collective Cancer Invasion.” &lt;i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America&lt;/i> 120.27 (2023): e2305410120.

However, little is known about the anti-carcinogenic effects of kava on tobacco smoking-related bladder cancer and its underlying mechanisms. Here we show that dietary feeding of kawain (a major active component in kava root extracts) to mice either before or after hydroxy butyl(butyl) nitrosamine (OH-BBN) carcinogen exposure slows down urinary bladder carcinogenesis and prolongs the survival of the OH-BBN-exposed mice. OH-BBN-induced bladder tumors exhibit significantly increased expression of lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1), accompanied by decreased levels of H3K4 mono-methylation compared to normal bladder epithelium, whereas dietary kawain reverses the effects of OH-BBN on H3K4 mono-methylation. Human bladder cancer tumor tissues at different pathological grades also show significantly increased expression of LSD1 and decreased levels of H3K4 mono-methylation compared to normal urothelium. In addition, kava root extracts and the kavalactones kawain and methysticin all increase the levels of H3K4 mono- and di-methylation, leading to inhibitory effects on cell migration.

Here we show that dietary feeding of kawain (a major active component in kava root extracts) to mice either before or after hydroxy butyl(butyl) nitrosamine (OH-BBN) carcinogen exposure slows down urinary bladder carcinogenesis and prolongs the survival of the OH-BBN-exposed mice. OH-BBN-induced bladder tumors exhibit significantly increased expression of lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1), accompanied by decreased levels of H3K4 mono-methylation compared to normal bladder epithelium, whereas dietary kawain reverses the effects of OH-BBN on H3K4 mono-methylation. Human bladder cancer tumor tissues at different pathological grades also show significantly increased expression of LSD1 and decreased levels of H3K4 mono-methylation compared to normal urothelium. In addition, kava root extracts and the kavalactones kawain and methysticin all increase the levels of H3K4 mono- and di-methylation, leading to inhibitory effects on cell migration. Taken together, our results suggest that modification of histone lysine methylation may represent a new approach to bladder cancer prevention and treatment and that kavalactones may be promising agents for bladder cancer interception in both current and former smokers.\nDOI: 10.3390/biom13030521, https://doi.org/10.3390/biom13030521\n\nPubMedID: 36979456, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36979456\nPubMedCentralID: PMC10046577, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10046577&#34;,&#34;value&#34;:null},&#34;doiId&#34;:&#34;10.3390/biom13030521&#34;,&#34;doiUrl&#34;:&#34;https://doi.org/10.3390/biom13030521&#34;,&#34;featured&#34;:false,&#34;firstPublished&#34;:{&#34;html&#34;:&#34;Mar 13, 2023 00:00:00 AM&#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;Mar 13, 2023 00:00:00 AM&#34;,&#34;value&#34;:&#34;2023-03-13T00:00:00.000-07:00&#34;},&#34;mlaCitation&#34;:&#34;Xu, Xia et al. “Kawain Inhibits Urinary Bladder Carcinogenesis through Epigenetic Inhibition of LSD1 and Upregulation of H3K4 Methylation.” &lt;i>Biomolecules&lt;/i> 13.3 (2023): n. pag.

We therefore designed a surgeon-guided framework to extract short video clips with bladder lesions for more efficient content navigation and extraction. Screenshots of bladder lesions were captured during transurethral resection of bladder tumor, then manually labeled according to case identification, date, lesion location, imaging modality, and pathology. The framework used the screenshot to search for and extract a corresponding 10-seconds video clip. Each video clip included a one-second space holder with a QR barcode informing the video content. The success of the framework was measured by the secondary use of these short clips and the reduction of storage volume required for video materials. From 86 cases, the framework successfully generated 249 video clips from 230 screenshots, with 14 erroneous video clips from 8 screenshots excluded. The HIPPA-compliant barcodes provided information of video contents with a 100% data completeness. A web-based educational gallery was curated with various diagnostic categories and annotated frame sequences. Compared with the unedited videos, the informative short video clips reduced the storage volume by 99.5%. In conclusion, our framework expedites the generation of visual contents with surgeon&#39;s instruction for cystoscopy and potential incorporation of video data towards applications including clinical documentation, education, and research.&#34;},{&#34;apaCitation&#34;:&#34;Eminaga, O., Shkolyar, E., Breil, B., Semjonow, A., Boegemann, M., Xing, L., … Liao, J.

Our objective was to determine if BLC improves recurrence detection in patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) undergoing BCG.Using the prospective multi-institutional Cysview® Registry (2014-2019), patients with NMIBC who received BCG within 1 year prior to BLC were identified. Primary outcomes were recurrences and whether lesions were detected on white light cystoscopy (WLC), BLC or both. We calculated the percentage of cystoscopies with recurrences that were missed with WLC alone. The cystoscopy-level BLC false-positive rate was the proportion of cystoscopies with biopsies only due to BLC suspicious lesions without recurrence.Of 1,703 BLCs, 282 cystoscopies were in the analytic cohort. The overall recurrence rate was 45.0% (127). With only WLC, 13% (16/127) of recurrences would have been missed as 5.7% (16/282) of cystoscopies performed had recurrence only identified with BLC. Among 16 patients with recurrence missed with WLC, 88% (14) had carcinoma in situ. The cystoscopy-level BLC false-positive rate was 5% (15).BLC helped detect recurrences after recent BCG that would have been missed with WLC alone. Providers should consider BLC for high-risk patients undergoing BCG and should discuss the risk of false-positives with these patients. As clinical trials of novel therapies for BCG-unresponsive disease increase and there are no clear guidelines on BLC use for post-treatment cystoscopies, it is important to consider how variable BLC use could affect enrollment in and comparisons of these studies.&lt;/p>\n  &lt;p class=\&#34;doi\&#34;>\n    &lt;span>View details for &lt;a href=\&#34;https://doi.org/10.1097/JU.0000000000002308\&#34;>DOI 10.1097/JU.0000000000002308&lt;/a>&lt;/span>\n  &lt;/p>\n  &lt;p class=\&#34;pub-med\&#34;>\n    &lt;span>View details for &lt;a href=\&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34694916\&#34;>PubMedID 34694916&lt;/a>&lt;/span>\n  &lt;/p>&#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;Abstract:\nThe utility of blue light cystoscopy (BLC) in patients receiving bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) during post-treatment cystoscopy is not well understood.

The cystoscopy-level BLC false-positive rate was the proportion of cystoscopies with biopsies only due to BLC suspicious lesions without recurrence.Of 1,703 BLCs, 282 cystoscopies were in the analytic cohort. The overall recurrence rate was 45.0% (127). With only WLC, 13% (16/127) of recurrences would have been missed as 5.7% (16/282) of cystoscopies performed had recurrence only identified with BLC. Among 16 patients with recurrence missed with WLC, 88% (14) had carcinoma in situ. The cystoscopy-level BLC false-positive rate was 5% (15).BLC helped detect recurrences after recent BCG that would have been missed with WLC alone. Providers should consider BLC for high-risk patients undergoing BCG and should discuss the risk of false-positives with these patients. As clinical trials of novel therapies for BCG-unresponsive disease increase and there are no clear guidelines on BLC use for post-treatment cystoscopies, it is important to consider how variable BLC use could affect enrollment in and comparisons of these studies.\nDOI: 10.1097/JU.0000000000002308, https://doi.org/10.1097/JU.0000000000002308\n\nPubMedID: 34694916, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34694916&#34;,&#34;value&#34;:null},&#34;doiId&#34;:&#34;10.1097/JU.0000000000002308&#34;,&#34;doiUrl&#34;:&#34;https://doi.org/10.1097/JU.0000000000002308&#34;,&#34;featured&#34;:false,&#34;firstPublished&#34;:{&#34;html&#34;:&#34;Mar 1, 2022 00:00:00 AM&#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;Mar 1, 2022 00:00:00 AM&#34;,&#34;value&#34;:&#34;2022-03-01T00:00:00.000-08:00&#34;},&#34;mlaCitation&#34;:&#34;Chappidi, Meera R. et al. “Utility of Blue Light Cystoscopy for Post-Bacillus Calmette-Guérin Bladder Cancer Recurrence Detection: Implications for Clinical Trial Recruitment and Study Comparisons.” &lt;i>The Journal of urology&lt;/i> 207.3 (2022): 534–540.

Our objective was to determine if BLC improves recurrence detection in patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) undergoing BCG.Using the prospective multi-institutional Cysview® Registry (2014-2019), patients with NMIBC who received BCG within 1 year prior to BLC were identified. Primary outcomes were recurrences and whether lesions were detected on white light cystoscopy (WLC), BLC or both. We calculated the percentage of cystoscopies with recurrences that were missed with WLC alone. The cystoscopy-level BLC false-positive rate was the proportion of cystoscopies with biopsies only due to BLC suspicious lesions without recurrence.Of 1,703 BLCs, 282 cystoscopies were in the analytic cohort.

One factor contributing to the rise of multi-drug-resistant (MDR) pathogens is the reliance on traditional culture-based pathogen identification (ID) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) that typically takes several days. This delay of objective pathogen ID and AST information to inform clinical decision making results in clinicians treating patients empirically often using first-line, broad-spectrum antibiotics, contributing to the misuse/overuse of antibiotics. To combat the rise in MDR pathogens, there is a critical demand for rapid ID and AST technologies. Among the advances in ID and AST technologies in the past decade, single-cell diagnostic technologies powered by droplet microfluidics offer great promise due to their potential for high-sensitivity detection and rapid turnaround time. Our laboratory has been at the forefront of developing such technologies and applying them to diagnosing urinary tract infections (UTIs), one of the most common infections and a frequent reason for the prescription of antimicrobials. For pathogen ID, we first demonstrated the highly sensitive, amplification-free detection of single bacterial cells by confining them in picoliter-scale droplets and detection with fluorogenic peptide nucleic acid (PNA) probes that target their 16S rRNA (rRNA), a well-characterized marker for phylogenic classification. We subsequently improved the PNA probe design and enhanced detection sensitivity. For single-cell AST, we first employed a growth indicator dye and engineered an integrated device that allows us to detect growth from single bacterial cells under antibiotic exposure within 1 h, equivalent to two to three bacterial replications. To expand beyond testing a single antibiotic condition per device, a common limitation for droplet microfluidics, we developed an integrated programmable droplet microfluidic device for scalable single-cell AST. Using the scalable single-cell AST platform, we demonstrated the generation of up to 32 droplet groups in a single device with custom antibiotic titers and the capacity to scale up single-cell AST, and providing reliable pathogen categories beyond a binary call embodies a critical advance. Finally, we developed an integrated ID and AST platform. To this end, we developed a PNA probe panel that can identify nearly 90% of uropathogens and showed the quantitative detection of 16S rRNA from single bacterial cells in droplet-enabled AST after as little as 10 min of antibiotic exposure. This platform achieved both ID and AST from minimally processed urine samples in 30 min, representing one of the fastest turnaround times to date. In addition to tracing the development of our technologies, we compare them with contemporary research advances and offer our perspectives for future development, with the vision that single-cell ID and AST technologies powered by droplet microfluidics can indeed become a useful diagnostic tool for combating antimicrobial resistance.&lt;/p>\n  &lt;p class=\&#34;doi\&#34;>\n    &lt;span>View details for &lt;a href=\&#34;https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.accounts.1c00462\&#34;>DOI 10.1021/acs.accounts.1c00462&lt;/a>&lt;/span>\n  &lt;/p>\n  &lt;p class=\&#34;pub-med\&#34;>\n    &lt;span>View details for &lt;a href=\&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34898173\&#34;>PubMedID 34898173&lt;/a>&lt;/span>\n  &lt;/p>&#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;Abstract:\nConspectusAntimicrobial resistance is a global threat that if left unchecked could lead to 10 million annual mortalities by 2050.

To expand beyond testing a single antibiotic condition per device, a common limitation for droplet microfluidics, we developed an integrated programmable droplet microfluidic device for scalable single-cell AST. Using the scalable single-cell AST platform, we demonstrated the generation of up to 32 droplet groups in a single device with custom antibiotic titers and the capacity to scale up single-cell AST, and providing reliable pathogen categories beyond a binary call embodies a critical advance. Finally, we developed an integrated ID and AST platform. To this end, we developed a PNA probe panel that can identify nearly 90% of uropathogens and showed the quantitative detection of 16S rRNA from single bacterial cells in droplet-enabled AST after as little as 10 min of antibiotic exposure. This platform achieved both ID and AST from minimally processed urine samples in 30 min, representing one of the fastest turnaround times to date. In addition to tracing the development of our technologies, we compare them with contemporary research advances and offer our perspectives for future development, with the vision that single-cell ID and AST technologies powered by droplet microfluidics can indeed become a useful diagnostic tool for combating antimicrobial resistance.\nDOI: 10.1021/acs.accounts.1c00462, https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.accounts.1c00462\n\nPubMedID: 34898173, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34898173&#34;,&#34;value&#34;:null},&#34;doiId&#34;:&#34;10.1021/acs.accounts.1c00462&#34;,&#34;doiUrl&#34;:&#34;https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.accounts.1c00462&#34;,&#34;featured&#34;:false,&#34;firstPublished&#34;:{&#34;html&#34;:&#34;Dec 13, 2021 00:00:00 AM&#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;Dec 13, 2021 00:00:00 AM&#34;,&#34;value&#34;:&#34;2021-12-13T00:00:00.000-08:00&#34;},&#34;mlaCitation&#34;:&#34;Hsieh, Kuangwen et al. “Combating Antimicrobial Resistance via Single-Cell Diagnostic Technologies Powered by Droplet Microfluidics.” &lt;i>Accounts of chemical research&lt;/i> (1800): n. pag.

One factor contributing to the rise of multi-drug-resistant (MDR) pathogens is the reliance on traditional culture-based pathogen identification (ID) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) that typically takes several days. This delay of objective pathogen ID and AST information to inform clinical decision making results in clinicians treating patients empirically often using first-line, broad-spectrum antibiotics, contributing to the misuse/overuse of antibiotics. To combat the rise in MDR pathogens, there is a critical demand for rapid ID and AST technologies. Among the advances in ID and AST technologies in the past decade, single-cell diagnostic technologies powered by droplet microfluidics offer great promise due to their potential for high-sensitivity detection and rapid turnaround time. Our laboratory has been at the forefront of developing such technologies and applying them to diagnosing urinary tract infections (UTIs), one of the most common infections and a frequent reason for the prescription of antimicrobials. For pathogen ID, we first demonstrated the highly sensitive, amplification-free detection of single bacterial cells by confining them in picoliter-scale droplets and detection with fluorogenic peptide nucleic acid (PNA) probes that target their 16S rRNA (rRNA), a well-characterized marker for phylogenic classification. We subsequently improved the PNA probe design and enhanced detection sensitivity. For single-cell AST, we first employed a growth indicator dye and engineered an integrated device that allows us to detect growth from single bacterial cells under antibiotic exposure within 1 h, equivalent to two to three bacterial replications. To expand beyond testing a single antibiotic condition per device, a common limitation for droplet microfluidics, we developed an integrated programmable droplet microfluidic device for scalable single-cell AST.

An opioid-free discharge protocol was initiated targeting all areas of surgical care from June 20th, 2019 to September 20th, 2019 as part of an institutional quality improvement initiative. Demographic and surgical data were collected as were morphine equivalent doses (MEDs) prescribed at discharge, postoperative measures including phone calls, clinic visits, and emergency room visits for pain.Results: Between October 1st, 2017 and February 1st, 2018, a total of 54 patients who underwent ureteroscopy were identified and comprised the historical control cohort while 54 prospective patients met the inclusion criteria since institution of the quality improvement initiative. There were no statistically significant differences in baseline patient demographics or surgical characteristics between the 2 patient groups.

We aimed to evaluate what affects patient treatment preferences.METHODS: Patients with urinary stone disease completed a choice-based conjoint analysis exercise assessing four treatment attributes associated with URS and PCNL. A sensitivity analysis using a market simulator was performed and the relative importance of each attribute was calculated. Differences in treatment preferences by demographic subgroup were assessed.RESULTS: A total of 58 patients completed the conjoint analysis exercise. Stone-free rate was the most important treatment attribute while length of hospital stay and cosmesis were less important. Overall, sensitivity analysis based on market simulation scenarios predicted almost equal preference for URS (52.4%) compared to PCNL (47.6%) for treatment of an intermediate-size stone. Older patients (>65 yo) expressed stronger preferences for lower infection rates and shorter hospital stays, and were more likely to prefer URS (67.2%, 95% CI: 52 - 82.5%) compared to younger patients (20-34 yo) (20.3%, 95% CI: 0 - 41.5%) who preferred higher procedure success rates and fewer repeat procedures.CONCLUSION: Conjoint analysis predicts nearly equal patient preference for URS or PCNL for the treatment of intermediate-size kidney stones. Older patients prefer the lower UTI risk and shorter hospital stay associated with URS, while younger patients prefer higher stone-free rates associated with PCNL.

We compare the performance of artificial neural networks (ANN), a type of machine learning algorithm, with that of multivariable Cox proportional hazards (CPH) models in the prediction of 5-year disease-specific survival (DSS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with bladder cancer.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The National Cancer Institute&#39;s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) 18 program database was queried to identify adult patients with bladder cancer diagnosed between 1995 and 2010, yielding 161,227 patients who met our inclusion criteria. ANNs were trained and tested on an 80/20 split of the dataset. Multivariable CPH models were developed in parallel. Variables used for prediction included age, sex, race, grade, SEER stage, tumor size, lymph node involvement, degree of extension, and surgery received. The primary outcomes were 5-year DSS and 5-year OS. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was conducted, and ANN models were tested for calibration.RESULTS: The area under the curve for the ANN models was 0.81 for the OS model and 0.80 for the DSS model. Area under the curve for the CPH models was 0.70 for OS and 0.81 for DSS. The ANN OS model achieved a calibration slope of 1.03 and a calibration intercept of -0.04, while the ANN DSS model achieved a calibration slope of 0.99 and a calibration intercept of -0.04.CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning algorithms can improve our ability to predict bladder cancer prognosis. Compared to CPH models, ANNs predicted OS more accurately and DSS with similar accuracy.

Area under the curve for the CPH models was 0.70 for OS and 0.81 for DSS. The ANN OS model achieved a calibration slope of 1.03 and a calibration intercept of -0.04, while the ANN DSS model achieved a calibration slope of 0.99 and a calibration intercept of -0.04.CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning algorithms can improve our ability to predict bladder cancer prognosis. Compared to CPH models, ANNs predicted OS more accurately and DSS with similar accuracy.

Given the successful application of machine learning to handle big data in many disciplines outside of medicine, we sought to determine if machine learning could be used to improve our ability to predict survival in bladder cancer patients. We compare the performance of artificial neural networks (ANN), a type of machine learning algorithm, with that of multivariable Cox proportional hazards (CPH) models in the prediction of 5-year disease-specific survival (DSS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with bladder cancer.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The National Cancer Institute&#39;s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) 18 program database was queried to identify adult patients with bladder cancer diagnosed between 1995 and 2010, yielding 161,227 patients who met our inclusion criteria. ANNs were trained and tested on an 80/20 split of the dataset. Multivariable CPH models were developed in parallel. Variables used for prediction included age, sex, race, grade, SEER stage, tumor size, lymph node involvement, degree of extension, and surgery received. The primary outcomes were 5-year DSS and 5-year OS. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was conducted, and ANN models were tested for calibration.RESULTS: The area under the curve for the ANN models was 0.81 for the OS model and 0.80 for the DSS model. Area under the curve for the CPH models was 0.70 for OS and 0.81 for DSS. The ANN OS model achieved a calibration slope of 1.03 and a calibration intercept of -0.04, while the ANN DSS model achieved a calibration slope of 0.99 and a calibration intercept of -0.04.CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning algorithms can improve our ability to predict bladder cancer prognosis. Compared to CPH models, ANNs predicted OS more accurately and DSS with similar accuracy.

Pre and post-PGA volumes of prostate segments were compared. Post-PGA mpMRI were categorized according to PI-RADS v2 and treatment response on mpMRI was assessed in a manner similar to the radiology evaluation framework following liver lesion ablation.RESULTS: Median volume of ipsilateral peripheral and transition zones decreased from 10.9 mL and 13.0 mL to 7.2 mL and 10.8 mL (p=0.005), respectively. Median volume of contralateral peripheral and transition zones also decreased from 12.1 mL and 12.5 mL to 9.9 mL to 10.4 mL (p=0.005), respectively. Five men had clinically significant disease (Grade group ≥2) on post-PGA biopsy (three within treatment field and two outside). Of the men with clinically significant prostate cancer, mpMRI revealed PI-RADS 3 lesions in two. However, the treatment response framework did not detect residual disease.CONCLUSION: PGA results in asymmetric and significant reductions in prostate volume. Our results highlight the need for a separate assessment framework to enable standardization of the interpretation and reporting of post-PGA surveillance mpMRI.

We sought to determine the prevalence of urinary stone disease in pregnancy and whether urinary stone disease during pregnancy is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified all pregnant women from 2003 through 2017 in the Optum national insurance claims database. We used diagnosis claims to identify urinary stone disease and assess medical comorbidity. We established the prevalence of urinary stone disease during pregnancy, stratified by week of pregnancy. We further evaluated associations among urinary stone disease and maternal complications and pregnancy outcomes in both univariable and multivariable analyses.RESULTS: Urinary stone disease affects 8/1000 pregnancies and is more common in white women and women with more comorbid conditions. In fully adjusted models, pregnancies complicated by urinary stone disease had higher rates of adverse fetal outcomes, including prematurity and spontaneous abortions. This analysis is limited by its retrospective administrative claims design.CONCLUSIONS: The rate of urinary stone disease during pregnancy is higher than previously reported.

Herein, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept combination of a rapid microfluidic assay and an efficient cell filtration process that enables a path toward integrating rapid tests directly into pharmaceutical microbiological screening workflows. We demonstrate separation and detection of Escherichia coli directly captured and analyzed from a mammalian (i.e., CHO) cell culture with a 3.0 h incubation. The demonstration is performed using a membrane filtration module that is compatible with sampling from bioreactors, enabling in-line sampling and process monitoring.&#34;},{&#34;apaCitation&#34;:&#34;Daneshmand, S., Bazargani, S.

White light cystoscopy remains the cornerstone for the management of non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer. In the last decade, significant technological improvements have been introduced for optical imaging to address the known shortcomings of white light cystoscopy. Enhanced cystoscopy modalities such as blue light cystoscopy and narrowband imaging survey a large area of the urothelium and provide contrast enhancement to detect additional lesions and decrease cancer recurrence. However, higher false-positive rates accompany the gain of sensitivity. Optical biopsy technologies, including confocal laser endomicroscopy and optical coherence tomography, provide cellular resolutions combined with subsurface imaging, thereby enabling optical-based cancer characterization, and may lead to real-time cancer grading and staging. Coupling of fluorescently labeled binding agents with optical imaging devices may translate into high molecular specificity, thus enabling visualization and characterization of biological processes at the molecular level. For cross-sectional imaging, upper urinary tract evaluation and assessment potential extravesical tumor extension and metastases are currently the primary roles, particularly for management of muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Multi-parametric MRI, including dynamic gadolinium-enhanced and diffusion-weighted sequences, has been investigated for primary bladder tumor detection. Ultrasmall superparamagnetic particles of iron oxide (USPIO) are a new class of contrast agents that increased the accuracy of lymph node imaging. Combination of multi-parametric MRI with positron emission tomography is on the horizon to improve accuracy rates for primary tumor diagnostics as well as lymph node evaluation. As these high-resolution optical and cross-sectional technologies emerge and develop, judicious assessment and validation await for their clinical integration toward improving the overall management of bladder cancer.&#34;},{&#34;apaCitation&#34;:&#34;Liem, E.

A rapid diagnostic test for UTI may improve patient care and antibiotic stewardship.OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate an integrated biosensor assay for UTI diagnosis, including pathogen ID and AST, with determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for ciprofloxacin.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Urine samples positive for Enterobacteriaceae (n=84) or culture-negative (n=23) were obtained from the Stanford Clinical Microbiology Laboratory between November 2013 and September 2014. Each sample was diluted and cultured for 5h with and without ciprofloxacin, followed by quantitative detection of bacterial 16S rRNA using a single electrochemical biosensor array functionalized with a panel of complementary DNA probes. Pathogen ID was determined using universal bacterial, Enterobacteriaceae (EB), and pathogen-specific probes. Phenotypic AST with ciprofloxacin MIC was determined using an EB probe to measure 16S rRNA levels as a function of bacterial growth.MEASUREMENTS: Electrochemical signals for pathogen ID at 6 SD over background were considered positive. An MIC signal of 0.4 log units lower than the no-antibiotic control indicated sensitivity. Results were compared to clinical microbiology reports.RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: For pathogen ID, the assay had 98.5% sensitivity, 96.6% specificity, 93.0% positive predictive value, and 99.3% negative predictive value. For ciprofloxacin MIC the categorical and essential agreement was 97.6%. Further automation, testing of additional pathogens and antibiotics, and a full prospective study will be necessary for translation to clinical use.CONCLUSIONS: The integrated biosensor platform achieved microbiological results including MIC comparable to standard culture in a significantly shorter assay time. Further assay automation will allow clinical translation for rapid molecular diagnosis of UTI.PATIENT SUMMARY: We have developed and validated a biosensor test for rapid diagnosis of urinary tract infections.

The accuracy of the 3-marker panel in the independent validation cohort yielded an area under the curve of 0.87 and overall 83% sensitivity and 89% specificity.Urine-based molecular diagnostics using this 3-marker signature could provide a valuable adjunct to cystoscopy and may lead to a reduction of unnecessary procedures for bladder cancer diagnosis.&#34;},{&#34;apaCitation&#34;:&#34;Kaushik, A.

Participants discussed several critical topics in the field of bladder cancer: 1) Best practices for tissue analysis and use to optimize correlative studies, 2) Modeling bladder cancer to facilitate understanding and innovation, 3) Targeted therapies for bladder cancer, 4) Tumor phylogeny in bladder cancer, 5) New Innovations in bladder cancer diagnostics. Our understanding of and approach to treating urothelial carcinoma is undergoing rapid advancement. Preclinical models of bladder cancer have been leveraged to increase our basic and mechanistic understanding of the disease. With the approval of immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of advanced urothelial carcinoma, the treatment approach for these patients has quickly changed. In this light, molecularly-defined subtypes of bladder cancer and appropriate pre-clinical models are now essential to the further advancement and appropriate application of these therapeutic improvements. The optimal collection and processing of clinical urothelial carcinoma tissues samples will also be critical in the development of predictive biomarkers for therapeutic selection. Technological advances in other areas including optimal imaging technologies and micro/nanotechnologies are being applied to bladder cancer, especially in the localized setting, and hold the potential for translational impact in the treatment of bladder cancer patients.

Therefore, we review the potential of this technology to improve outcomes in surgical oncology with attention to the various surgical procedures while exploring trial endpoints that may be optimal for each tumor type.For many tumors, primary treatment is surgical resection with negative margins, which corresponds to improved survival and a reduction in subsequent adjuvant therapies. Despite unfavorable effect on patient outcomes, margin positivity rate has not changed significantly over the years. Thus, patients often experience high rates of re-excision, radical resections, and overtreatment.

An extended computational model of ACEF, which considers the effects of the density gradient and temperature-dependent parameters, is developed and compared experimentally by particle image velocimetry. The model captures the essence of ACEF in a wide range of channel dimensions and operating conditions. The combined experimental and computational study reveals the essential roles of buoyancy, temperature rise, and associated changes in material properties in the formation of the long-range fluid motion. Our results provide critical information for the design and modeling of ACEF based microfluidic systems toward various bioanalytical applications.&#34;},{&#34;apaCitation&#34;:&#34;Davenport, M.

We sought to evaluate the feasibility of confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) during RARP.Twenty-one patients with biopsy-proven prostate cancer scheduled for RARP were recruited. After intravenous administration of fluorescein, 15 patients underwent in vivo intraoperative CLE of prostatic and periprostatic structures using either a 2.6-mm or 0.85-mm imaging probe. Standard robotic instruments were used to grasp and maneuver the CLE probes for image acquisition. CLE imaging was performed ex vivo on fresh prostate specimens from 20 patients. Confocal video sequences acquired in vivo and ex vivo were reviewed and analyzed, with additional image processing using a mosaicing algorithm. Processed confocal images were compared with standard hematoxylin and eosin analysis of imaged regions.CLE was successfully integrated with robotic surgery, including co-registration of confocal video sequences with white light and probe handling with standard robotic instrumentation. Intraoperative CLE imaging of the neurovascular bundle prior to and following nerve-sparing dissection revealed characteristic features including dynamic vascular flow and intact axon fibers. Ex vivo confocal imaging of the prostatic parenchyma demonstrated the normal prostatic glands, stroma, and prostate carcinoma.We report the initial feasibility of optical biopsy of prostatic and periprostatic tissue during RARP.

In bladder, another organ of endodermal origin, we find that despite its initial presence in the cancer cell of origin Sonic hedgehog (Shh) expression is invariably lost during progression to invasive urothelial carcinoma. Genetic blockade of stromal response to Shh furthermore dramatically accelerates progression and decreases survival time. This cancer-restraining effect of Hh pathway activity is associated with stromal expression of BMP signals, which stimulate urothelial differentiation.

Herein, we demonstrate an in situ electrokinetic stringency control approach for a self-assembled monolayer-based electrochemical biosensor toward urinary tract infection diagnosis. The in situ electrokinetic stringency control technique generates Joule heating induced temperature rise and electrothermal fluid motion directly on the sensor to improve its performance for detecting bacterial 16S rRNA, a phylogenetic biomarker. The dependence of the hybridization efficiency reveals that in situ electrokinetic stringency control is capable of discriminating single-base mismatches. With electrokinetic stringency control, the background noise due to the matrix effects of clinical urine samples can be reduced by 60%. The applicability of the system is demonstrated by multiplex detection of three uropathogenic clinical isolates with similar 16S rRNA sequences. The results demonstrate that electrokinetic stringency control can significantly improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the biosensor for multiplex urinary tract infection diagnosis.Urinary tract infections remain a significant cause of mortality and morbidity as secondary conditions often related to chronic diseases or to immunosuppression.

The electrokinetic technique achieves a loading efficiency of about 75% with a negligible effect on the bacterial growth rate. To optimize the protocol for single cell AST, the bacterial growth rate of individual bacteria under different antibiotic conditions has been determined systematically. The applicability of single cell AST is demonstrated by the rapid determination of the antimicrobial resistant profiles of uropathogenic clinical isolates in Mueller-Hinton media and in urine.

We explored technological principles, preclinical and clinical evidence supporting nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer detection and characterization, and whether improved sensitivity vs specificity translates into improved correlation of diagnostic accuracy with recurrence and progression. Emerging preclinical technologies with potential application were reviewed.Photodynamic diagnosis and narrow band imaging improve nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer detection, including carcinoma in situ. Photodynamic diagnosis identifies more papillary lesions than white light cystoscopy, enabling more complete resection and fewer residual tumors. Despite improved treatment current data on photodynamic diagnosis do not support improved high risk diathetic detection and characterization or correlation with disease progression. Prospective recurrence data are lacking on narrow band imaging. Confocal laser endomicroscopy and optical coherence tomography potentially grade and stage lesions but data are lacking on diagnostic accuracy. Several emerging preclinical technologies may enhance the diagnostic capability of endoscopic imaging.New optical imaging technologies may improve bladder cancer detection and characterization, and transurethral resection quality. While data on photodynamic diagnosis are strongest, the clinical effectiveness of these technologies is not proven. Prospective studies are needed, particularly of narrow band imaging, confocal laser endomicroscopy and optical coherence tomography. As each technology matures and new ones emerge, cost-effectiveness analysis must be addressed in the context of the various bladder cancer types.&lt;/p>\n  &lt;p class=\&#34;doi\&#34;>\n    &lt;span>View details for &lt;a href=\&#34;https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.juro.2012.03.127\&#34;>DOI 10.1016/j.juro.2012.03.127&lt;/a>&lt;/span>\n  &lt;/p>\n  &lt;p class=\&#34;wos\&#34;>\n    &lt;span>View details for &lt;a href=\&#34;https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;amp;rft_id=info:ut/000306270600006\&#34;>Web of Science ID 000306270600006&lt;/a>&lt;/span>\n  &lt;/p>\n  &lt;p class=\&#34;pub-med\&#34;>\n    &lt;span>View details for &lt;a href=\&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22698620\&#34;>PubMedID 22698620&lt;/a>&lt;/span>\n  &lt;/p>\n  &lt;p class=\&#34;pub-med-central\&#34;>\n    &lt;span>View details for &lt;a href=\&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4035237\&#34;>PubMedCentralID PMC4035237&lt;/a>&lt;/span>\n  &lt;/p>&#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;Abstract:\nBladder cancer presents as a spectrum of different diatheses.

Accurate assessment for individualized treatment depends on initial diagnostic accuracy. Detection relies on white light cystoscopy accuracy and comprehensiveness. Aside from invasiveness and potential risks, white light cystoscopy shortcomings include difficult flat lesion detection, precise tumor delineation to enable complete resection, inflammation and malignancy differentiation, and grade and stage determination. Each shortcoming depends on surgeon ability and experience with the technology available for visualization and resection.

For detection of the protein biomarker, the biosensor used an analogous electrochemical sandwich assay based on capture and detector antibodies. For this assay, a set of oligonucleotide probes optimized for hybridization at 37°C to facilitate integration with the immunoassay was developed. This probe set targeted common uropathogens including E. coli, P. mirabilis, P. aeruginosa and Enterococcus spp. as well as less common uropathogens including Serratia, Providencia, Morganella and Staphylococcus spp. The biosensor assay for pathogen detection had a specificity of 97% and a sensitivity of 89%.

The suggested diagnostic criteria will formulate a guide for pCLE image interpretation in urology.Patients scheduled for transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) or nephrectomy were recruited. After white-light cystoscopy (WLC), fluorescein was administered as contrast. Different areas of the urinary tract were imaged with pCLE via direct contact between the confocal probe and the area of interest. Confocal images were subsequently compared with standard hematoxylin and eosin analysis.pCLE images were collected from 66 participants, including 2 patients who underwent nephrectomy. We identified key features associated with different anatomic landmarks of the urinary tract, including the kidney, ureter, bladder, prostate, and urethra.

The standard culture-based diagnosis of UTI has a typical delay of two to three days. In the absence of definitive microbiological diagnosis at the point of care, physicians frequently initiate empirical broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment, and this has contributed to the emergence of resistant pathogens. Biosensors are emerging as a powerful diagnostic platform for infectious diseases. Paralleling how blood glucose sensors revolutionized the management of diabetes, and how pregnancy tests are now conducted in the home, biosensors are poised to improve UTI diagnosis significantly. Biosensors are amenable to integration with microfluidic technology for point-of-care (POC) applications. This review focuses on promising biosensor technology for UTI diagnosis, including pathogen identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and hurdles to be surpassed in the translation of biosensor technology from bench to bedside.&#34;},{&#34;apaCitation&#34;:&#34;Pan, Y., Volkmer, J.-P., Liu, J.-J., Wu, K., Mach, K.

To address this threat in public health, a metamodel antimicrobial cocktail optimization (MACO) scheme is demonstrated for rapid screening of potent antibiotic cocktails using uropathogenic clinical isolates as model systems. With the MACO scheme, only 18 parallel trials were required to determine a potent antimicrobial cocktail out of hundreds of possible combinations. In particular, trimethoprim and gentamicin were identified to work synergistically for inhibiting the bacterial growth.

To address this threat in public health, a metamodel antimicrobial cocktail optimization (MACO) scheme is demonstrated for rapid screening of potent antibiotic cocktails using uropathogenic clinical isolates as model systems. With the MACO scheme, only 18 parallel trials were required to determine a potent antimicrobial cocktail out of hundreds of possible combinations. In particular, trimethoprim and gentamicin were identified to work synergistically for inhibiting the bacterial growth.

Electrochemical biosensors are well suited for urinary diagnostics due to their excellent sensitivity, low-cost, and ability to detect a wide variety of target molecules including nucleic acids and protein biomarkers. We report the development of an electrochemical immunosensor for direct detection of the urinary tract infection (UTI) biomarker lactoferrin from infected clinical samples. An electrochemical biosensor array with alkanethiolate self-assembled monolayer (SAM) was used. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was used to characterize the mixed SAM, consisted of 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid and 6-mercapto-1-hexanol. A sandwich amperometric immunoassay was developed for detection of lactoferrin from urine, with a detection limit of 145 pg/ml. We validated lactoferrin as a biomarker of pyuria (presence of white blood cells in urine), an important hallmark of UTI, in 111 patient-derived urine samples. Finally, we demonstrated multiplex detection of urinary pathogens and lactoferrin through simultaneous detection of bacterial nucleic acid (16S rRNA) and host immune response protein (lactoferrin) on a single sensor array.

We evaluated confocal laser endomicroscopy by imaging normal, malignant appearing and indeterminate bladder mucosa in a pilot study.Patients scheduled to undergo transurethral resection of bladder tumors were recruited during a 3-month period. After standard cystoscopy fluorescein was administered intravesically and/or intravenously as a contrast dye. A 2.6 mm probe based confocal laser endomicroscope was passed through a 26 Fr resectoscope to image normal and abnormal appearing areas. The images were collected with 488 nm excitation at 8 to 12 frames per second. The endomicroscopic images were compared with standard hematoxylin and eosin analysis of transurethral resection of bladder tumor specimens.Of the 27 recruited patients 8 had no cancer, 9 had low grade tumors, 9 had high grade tumors and 1 had a low grade tumor with a high grade focus. Endomicroscopic images demonstrated clear differences between normal mucosa, and low and high grade tumors. In normal urothelium larger umbrella cells are seen most superficially followed by smaller intermediate cells and the less cellular lamina propria. In contrast, low grade papillary tumors demonstrate densely arranged but normal-shaped small cells extending outward from fibrovascular cores. High grade tumors show markedly irregular architecture and cellular pleomorphism.We report the first study to our knowledge of in vivo confocal laser endomicroscopy in the urinary tract. Marked differences among normal urothelium, low grade tumors and high grade tumors were visualized.

After standard cystoscopy fluorescein was administered intravesically and/or intravenously as a contrast dye. A 2.6 mm probe based confocal laser endomicroscope was passed through a 26 Fr resectoscope to image normal and abnormal appearing areas. The images were collected with 488 nm excitation at 8 to 12 frames per second. The endomicroscopic images were compared with standard hematoxylin and eosin analysis of transurethral resection of bladder tumor specimens.Of the 27 recruited patients 8 had no cancer, 9 had low grade tumors, 9 had high grade tumors and 1 had a low grade tumor with a high grade focus. Endomicroscopic images demonstrated clear differences between normal mucosa, and low and high grade tumors. In normal urothelium larger umbrella cells are seen most superficially followed by smaller intermediate cells and the less cellular lamina propria. In contrast, low grade papillary tumors demonstrate densely arranged but normal-shaped small cells extending outward from fibrovascular cores. High grade tumors show markedly irregular architecture and cellular pleomorphism.We report the first study to our knowledge of in vivo confocal laser endomicroscopy in the urinary tract. Marked differences among normal urothelium, low grade tumors and high grade tumors were visualized. Pending further clinical investigation and technological improvement, confocal laser endomicroscopy may become a useful adjunct to conventional cystoscopy.\nDOI: 10.1016/j.juro.2009.06.039, https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.juro.2009.06.039\nWeb of Science ID: 000269764100016, https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:ut/000269764100016\nPubMedID: 19683270, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19683270&#34;,&#34;value&#34;:null},&#34;doiId&#34;:&#34;10.1016/j.juro.2009.06.039&#34;,&#34;doiUrl&#34;:&#34;https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.juro.2009.06.039&#34;,&#34;featured&#34;:false,&#34;firstPublished&#34;:{&#34;html&#34;:&#34;Oct 1, 2009 00:00:00 AM&#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;Oct 1, 2009 00:00:00 AM&#34;,&#34;value&#34;:&#34;2009-10-01T00:00:00.000-07:00&#34;},&#34;mlaCitation&#34;:&#34;Sonn, Geoffrey A. et al. “Optical Biopsy of Human Bladder Neoplasia With In Vivo Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy.” &lt;i>JOURNAL OF UROLOGY&lt;/i> 182.4 (2009): 1299–1305.

Great interest exists in developing other imaging technologies to augment or supplant conventional cystoscopy. Fibered confocal microscopy offers the promise of providing in vivo histopathologic information to help distinguish malignant from benign bladder lesions.

The overall postoperative bleeding requiring transfusion and urine leakage rates were 2.7% and 1.9%, respectively.The use of HAs and/or glues is routine in most centres performing LPN. The overall haemorrhage and urine leakage rates are low following LPN. More studies are needed to assess the potential role of HAs and/or glues in LPN.&#34;},{&#34;apaCitation&#34;:&#34;Breda, A., Stepanian, S. V., Liao, J., Lam, J.

To improve assay sensitivity, we examined the key steps that affect the current amplitude of the electrochemical signal. Efficient lysis and release of 16S rRNA from both gram-negative and -positive bacteria was achieved with an initial treatment with Triton X-100 and lysozyme followed by alkaline lysis, resulting in a 12-fold increase in electrochemical signal compared with alkaline lysis alone. The distance in nucleotides between the target hybridization sites of the detector and capture probes and the location of fluorescein modification on the detector probe contributed to a 23-fold change in signal intensity. These results demonstrate the importance of target-probe and probe-probe interactions in the detection of bacterial 16S rRNA using an electrochemical DNA sensor approach.&#34;},{&#34;apaCitation&#34;:&#34;Breda, A., Veale, J., Liao, J., &amp;amp; Schulam, P.

We report the outcomes of 31 patients with sarcomatoid RCC treated with a combination of surgical resection and immunotherapy.Patients were identified from the database of the University of California Los Angeles Kidney Cancer Program. We retrospectively reviewed the cases of 31 consecutive patients in whom sarcomatoid RCC was diagnosed between 1990 and 1997. Clinical stage, sites of metastasis, pathologic stage, and type of immunotherapy were abstracted from the medical records. The primary end point analyzed was overall survival, and a multivariate analysis was performed to distinguish any factors conferring an improved survivorship.Twenty-six percent of patients were male and 74% were female, and the median age was 59 years (range, 34 to 73 years). Length of follow-up ranged from 2 to 77 months (mean, 21.4 months). Twenty-eight patients (84%) had known metastases at the time of radical nephrectomy (67% had lung metastases and 40% had bone, 21% had liver, 33% had lymphatic, and 15% had brain metastases). Twenty-five patients (81%) received immunotherapy, including low-dose interleukin (IL)-2-based therapy (five patients), tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte-based therapy plus IL-2 (nine patients), high-dose IL-2-based therapy (nine patients), dendritic cell vaccine-based therapy (one patient), and interferon alpha-based therapy alone (one patient). Two patients (6%) achieved complete responses (median duration, 46+ months) and five patients (15%) achieved partial responses (median duration, 36 months). One- and 2-year overall survival rates were 48% and 37%, respectively. Using a multivariate analysis, age, sex, and percentage of sarcomatoid tumor (&lt; or >50%) did not significantly correlate with survival. Improved survival was found in patients receiving high-dose IL-2 therapy compared with patients treated with surgery alone or any other form of immunotherapy (P = .025). Adjusting for age, sex, and percentage of sarcomatoid tumor, the relative risk of death was 10.4 times higher in patients not receiving high-dose IL-2 therapy. Final pathologic T stage did not correlate significantly with outcome, but node-positive patients had a higher death rate per year of follow-up than did the rest of the population (1.26 v 0.76, Cox regression analysis).Surgical resection and high-dose IL-2-based immunotherapy may play a role in the treatment of sarcomatoid RCCs in select patients.&lt;/p>\n  &lt;p class=\&#34;wos\&#34;>\n    &lt;span>View details for &lt;a href=\&#34;https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;amp;rft_id=info:ut/000078384500015\&#34;>Web of Science ID 000078384500015&lt;/a>&lt;/span>\n  &lt;/p>\n  &lt;p class=\&#34;pub-med\&#34;>\n    &lt;span>View details for &lt;a href=\&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10080595\&#34;>PubMedID 10080595&lt;/a>&lt;/span>\n  &lt;/p>&#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;Abstract:\nSarcomatoid variants of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) are aggressive tumors that respond poorly to immunotherapy.

Length of follow-up ranged from 2 to 77 months (mean, 21.4 months). Twenty-eight patients (84%) had known metastases at the time of radical nephrectomy (67% had lung metastases and 40% had bone, 21% had liver, 33% had lymphatic, and 15% had brain metastases). Twenty-five patients (81%) received immunotherapy, including low-dose interleukin (IL)-2-based therapy (five patients), tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte-based therapy plus IL-2 (nine patients), high-dose IL-2-based therapy (nine patients), dendritic cell vaccine-based therapy (one patient), and interferon alpha-based therapy alone (one patient). Two patients (6%) achieved complete responses (median duration, 46+ months) and five patients (15%) achieved partial responses (median duration, 36 months). One- and 2-year overall survival rates were 48% and 37%, respectively. Using a multivariate analysis, age, sex, and percentage of sarcomatoid tumor (&lt; or >50%) did not significantly correlate with survival. Improved survival was found in patients receiving high-dose IL-2 therapy compared with patients treated with surgery alone or any other form of immunotherapy (P = .025). Adjusting for age, sex, and percentage of sarcomatoid tumor, the relative risk of death was 10.4 times higher in patients not receiving high-dose IL-2 therapy. Final pathologic T stage did not correlate significantly with outcome, but node-positive patients had a higher death rate per year of follow-up than did the rest of the population (1.26 v 0.76, Cox regression analysis).Surgical resection and high-dose IL-2-based immunotherapy may play a role in the treatment of sarcomatoid RCCs in select patients.&#34;},{&#34;apaCitation&#34;:&#34;Gill, H.

We report here that CALI is not mediated by photoinduced thermal denaturation but by photogenerated free radicals. Thermal diffusion calculations suggest that the temperature changes resulting from CALI are too small to cause thermal denaturation, and Arrhenius plots of CALI are inconsistent with a photothermal mechanism. CALI shows an energy dose reciprocity above a threshold and can be inhibited by free-radical quenchers, thus demonstrating a photochemical mechanism of protein inactivation. The type of quenchers that are effective in inhibiting CALI indicates that the active species is a hydrogen abstractor which is not derived from molecular oxygen. We suggest that the active free-radical species is the hydroxyl radical and its very short lifetime explains the spatial specificity of CALI such that half-maximal damage is effected within 15 A from the dye moiety and no significant damage occurs at 34 A. The data are consistent with free-radical formation resulting from a sequential two-photon process.&lt;/p>\n  &lt;p class=\&#34;wos\&#34;>\n    &lt;span>View details for &lt;a href=\&#34;https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;amp;rft_id=info:ut/A1994ND60200056\&#34;>Web of Science ID A1994ND60200056&lt;/a>&lt;/span>\n  &lt;/p>\n  &lt;p class=\&#34;pub-med\&#34;>\n    &lt;span>View details for &lt;a href=\&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8146171\&#34;>PubMedID 8146171&lt;/a>&lt;/span>\n  &lt;/p>\n  &lt;p class=\&#34;pub-med-central\&#34;>\n    &lt;span>View details for &lt;a href=\&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC43429\&#34;>PubMedCentralID PMC43429&lt;/a>&lt;/span>\n  &lt;/p>&#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;Abstract:\nChromophore-assisted laser inactivation (CALI) is a technique that selectively inactivates proteins of interest to elucidate their in vivo functions.

                    My research interest is focused on the improvement of clinical immunosuppression. I am  involved  in the evaluation of new immunosuppressive drugs, potentially more efficacious or less toxic.  My ultimate goal is to achieve tolerance, a state that would obviate the need for any drugs. I am an investigator part of a multidisciplinary tolerance induction project using total lymphoid irradiation and donor hematopoietic stem cells infusion after living donor kidney transplantation.

                    Our research aims to improve the global quality of care for patients with Urologic Cancer with a particular focus on kidney cancer. We are investigating novel proteomic platforms and assays to diagnose kidney cancer and predict response to therapy. We are evaluating the comparative effectiveness of various kidney cancer surgeries and their impact on chronic kidney disease and its downstream effects. We are applying epidemiology, bioinformatics, and health services methods to urologic conditions.
