                Sathvik Redrouthu: A Pioneer in Powering Humanity with Photon-Based Computers

                “Why do existing computers run on electricity if light is faster?"
              With that thought-provoking question, a revolutionary company,
                [Procyon Photonics](https://www.procyonphotonics.org/home)
                , was born. With the audacious vision to reinvent the computer, CEO and CTO Sathvik Redrouthu is taking technology where it has never gone before.
                The Beginning
              From an early age, Redrouthu was driven by an insatiable curiosity about discovering the inner workings of computers. This sparked an eight-year-long exploration of programming language theory. “I wanted to understand what happened under the hood when computer programs were run, down to the fundamental particles of reality,” he recalls. This quest led him to build multiple compilers and virtual machines from unlikely materials: marbles, Legos, and even water buckets.
                The Genesis of Procyon Photonics
              As a sixth-grader in the Stone Hill Middle School cafeteria in Ashburn, Virginia, Redrouthu held passionate conversations with his friends about building things from popsicle stick forts to JavaScript programs. These stimulating conversations morphed into the highly provocative question that would catalyze the genesis of Procyon Photonics: “Why do existing computers run on electricity if light is faster?"
              This query sparked more than just academic interest. Sathvik and his cofounder, Jagadeepram Maddipatla, reached out through the school's Facebook group, searching for like-minded individuals. Several volunteered, and Procyon Photonics transitioned from an intellectual endeavor to a high-stakes startup. Under Redrouthu's visionary guidance, the company is innovating a bold new frontier: photon-based computing.
                Challenges and Unconventional Solutions
              Realizing this vision was a herculean task. A high schooler daring to construct a computer "past humanity's current level of knowledge" faced enormous challenges. Sathvik immersed himself in subjects like computer engineering, compilers, hardware accelerators, and quantum optics. "I spent months surfing YouTube, with unfinished supercomputer designs scattered across my desk, in search of that elusive eureka moment," he recalls.
              The startup's first prototype came to life through sheer resourcefulness. With ambitious designs in hand, Sathvik and his cofounder zigzagged between investors and universities. Finally, after facing skepticism and nearly being escorted off a university campus, they found a willing ear under the condition they would cover all material costs. Spurred by this hard-won victory, they publicized and taught AI classes to their classmates to finance their vision.
                Alien-Grade Hardware: Setting a New Benchmark
              What makes Procyon Photonics truly extraordinary is its alien-grade hardware. Their photonic-based computing devices are energy-efficient marvels, boasting performance ratings comparable to supercomputers. For example, their prototypes are 55,000 times more energy-efficient than the Intel i9 and more than 100 times more efficient than Nvidia’s A100 or Google’s TPU. Equally impressive is that this was accomplished on a shoestring budget using funds earned from tutoring peers.
              The innovation hasn't gone unnoticed. Procyon received venture funding from 1517 Fund, backed by Peter Thiel, and piqued the interest of tech heavyweights like Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, whose conversational model, ChatGPT, has great computational demands able to be supported on Procyon Photonics’ optical computers.
                The Future: Light Powered Computing
              Sathvik Redrouthu envisions Procyon Photonics as a cornerstone in humanity's next computing revolution. "In the 1800s, Charles Babbage's mechanical gears and pulleys were cutting-edge. The next chapter, as we see it, belongs to photon-based computing. Our dream? To someday power the world with light," Sathvik states with absolute conviction.
              Through audacious ideas, relentless self-education, and the courage to defy convention, Sathvik Redrouthu and Procyon Photonics are not just pushing boundaries. They’re recreating them altogether. The next time you flick on a light switch, consider this: You may be looking at the future of computing.
