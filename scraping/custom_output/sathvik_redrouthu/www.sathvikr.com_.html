        <p>I graduated highschool in June 2024, but decided not to attend university. Instead, I created <a href="https://getinstachip.com">Instachip</a>, an EDA start-up company, and decided to go through a program called Y Combinator. I worked on chip design tooling for a bit, but decided to drop out of the Y Combinator program and join a chip company called Etched. Concurrently, I am working on Formal Verification research with Dr. Mark Santolucito at Columbia University.

        <p>Beyond foundational mathematics knowledge from Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, I am self-taught via textbooks and projects. I was inspired by Code.org when I was 7. When I was 10, I taught myself basic Combinatorics, Statistics, Algebra I and II, and Geometry, created video game sprites for Super Smash Flash 2, and sat-in on Trigonometry classes at Virginia Polytechnic University. When I was 12, I wrote my first toy interpreter, fostering an interest in programming language theory. I enjoy finding excuses to build interpreters (e.g., I built a custom programming language for Etched's Vestaboards, which are mini Smartboards).
            
        <p>Prior to Instachip, my Verilog community contributions include the <a href="https://github.com/getinstachip/vpm">Verilog Package Manager</a> and the <a href="https://verilogmodules.org">Verilog Module Registry</a>. At TJ, I</p>

            <li>Designed/taped out three small chips (O(1) matrix-vector multiplication, Vector Processing Unit (US18119437) concept, and more)</li>
            <li>Designed and implemented a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.06749">programming language for optical computers</a> - a tensor algebra DSL that compiles to an optical processor with better sparse tensor storage than NumPy</li>
