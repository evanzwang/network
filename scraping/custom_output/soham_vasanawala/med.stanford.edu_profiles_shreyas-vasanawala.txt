                            Current Research and Scholarly Interests
                            Our group is focused on developing new MRI techniques, and in particular, developing novel applications for children.  We take a comprehensive approach, exploring novel hardware, data acquisition, image reconstruction, and image analysis techniques.  These approaches are then evaluated for cardiovascular, abdominal, and musculoskeletal pediatric MRI exams.  Additionally, we seek to develop quantitative MRI methods, including those for cardiovascular function, renal function, and tumor perfusion.

                                  The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 177Lu-PSMA-617 in combination with Standard of Care, versus Standard of Care alone, in adult male patients with mHSPC. In this study, the SoC is defined as a combination of Androgen Receptor Directed Therapy + Androgen Deprivation Therapy. Approximately 1126 patients will be randomized in this study. As of 31-Jan-2024, 1144 participants have been enrolled in 20 countries.
                                    Stanford is currently not accepting patients for this trial.

                                MRI QSM Imaging for Iron Overload
                                  The overall goal of this project is to develop and validate a novel technique for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-based Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM) of the abdomen, for non-invasive assessment of liver iron deposition. In this work, study team will develop and optimize advanced data acquisition and image reconstruction methods to enable QSM of the abdomen. Further, investigators will determine the accuracy, repeatability, and reproducibility of abdominal QSM for iron quantification in patients with liver iron overload.

Excessive accumulation of iron in various organs, including the liver, which affects both adult and pediatric populations, is toxic and requires treatment aimed at reducing body iron stores. Accurate assessment of liver iron concentration is critical for the detection and staging of iron overload as well as for longitudinal monitoring during treatment.

In summary, this project will develop a novel MRI-based QSM technique designed for the abdomen and will validate it in pediatric and adult patients with liver iron overload. Upon successful validation, QSM will provide accurate, repeatable, and reproducible quantification of LIC based on a fundamental property of tissue.

                                A Study to Evaluate Sildenafil for the Treatment of Lymphatic Malformations
                                  There is an unsatisfied medical need for a first-line treatment of lymphatic malformations with a good benefit/risk profile. Based on a patient experience in the institution, the investigators plan to verify whether or not the medication sildenafil has a beneficial effect on lymphatic malformations. The investigators plan to do this by treating patients with lymphatic malformations with the medication sildenafil for a 20 week period. This is an investigator initiated study funded by an Innovations in Patient Care grant and a SPARK grant.

                                    My primary focus is application of new MR imaging technology to musculoskeletal problems.  Current projects include: Rapid MRI for Osteoarthritis, Weight-bearing cartilage imaging with MRI, and MRI-based models of muscle.  We are studying the application of new MR imaging techniques such as rapid imaging, real-time imaging, and short echo time imaging to learn more about biomechanics and pathology of bones and joints.  I am also interested in functional imaging approaches using PET-MRI.
