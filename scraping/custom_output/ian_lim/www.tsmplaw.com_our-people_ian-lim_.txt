                Lim
              林伟隆
                  LL.B. (Hons) (NUS)

              “It’s not what you know, it’s how you use what you know.”
                Ian may be urbane, cutting a dapper figure in his three-piece suit, but do not let his Clark Kent appearance fool you – journals rank him among some of the sharpest employment lawyers in Singapore.
                Heading the Labour & Employment desk that he had built from ground up over his two-plus decades at the firm, Ian specialises in both transactional and contentious employment and immigration law, particularly on issues of non-competition, dismissal, discrimination, harassment, retirement & re-employment, industrial relations, and data privacy and confidentiality. He counts among his clients multinationals including DHL, IBM, and Samsonite, and C-Suite executives.
                Fiercely loyal, the adrenaline junkie (football on the weekends, snowboarding on holidays) has supported the same underdog sports teams for over 30 years. And that unwavering allegiance extends to clients and colleagues. No wonder then that those same clients have also stuck by him for decades.
                Ian ran TSMP’s award-winning community services programme for many years. Before he handed over the reins to partner June Ho, he was instrumental in TSMP’s recognition by the National Volunteer & Philanthropy Centre (NVPC) as the 2018 SME winner in the renowned President’s Volunteerism & Philanthropy Award. He continues to be active in pro bono and community work, especially for migrant workers.
