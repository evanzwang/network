    "snippet": "The etching rate of p-GaN and AlGaN of the chosen recipe are 10 nm/min and 0.3 nm/min, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1 b, before reaching the AlGaN surface, the etch depth of p-GaN has a good linear relationship with etching time. Meanwhile, to completely remove the p-GaN over AlGaN, the appropriate etching time was determined to be 7min30s ..."
