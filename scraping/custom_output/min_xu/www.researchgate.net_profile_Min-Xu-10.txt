Using partial-offset stacks of P and S-converted waves reflecting off the top of the AML, we image four 2-4 km-long melt-rich sections spaced 5-10 km from each ot...

is highly susceptible to megathrust earthquakes. However, the thick sedimentary layers and their underlying
crustal structure of the Makran slab are still poorly understood. Here we present a high-resolution crustal velocity
model of the M...

                            Rheological differences may lead to discrepant thinning order of the crust and lithospheric mantle when the continent is passively stretched. The crust breaks up earlier than the lithospheric mantle under a low stretching rate when the lower crust is strong; otherwise, the lithospheric mantle may break up earlier than the crust. Here we report a ne...

It covers all orders of ridge discontinuities: first-order transform faults, second-order overlapping spreading centers, third-order small offset tectonic discontinuit...

                            Oceanic core complexes form by long-lived extension along detachment faults (in some instances for periods more than a million years), exposing sub-volcanic lithosphere at the seafloor. Seafloor sampling and deep drilling indicate that highly altered mantle peridotites and lower crustal gabbros are the dominant lithologies in these structures, but...

The longest-lived (detachment) faults slip for as long as 1-2 m.y. and ex...
