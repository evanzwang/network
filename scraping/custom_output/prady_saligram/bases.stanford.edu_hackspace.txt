                    Hackspace is a technical hub for builders! The team was was initiated in 2023 in response to a need for a space where technical-minded founders can come together to build projects and share ideas.
                    Throughout the year, Hackspace hosts weekly HackerHours on Friday afternoon where mentors are invited so that students can book one-on-one slots to get advice on an idea they are working on or even talk about their common interests. Furthermore, the Hackspace VPs are planning to host mini-challenges to engage newer builders and help them build their technical toolkit. These weekly HackerHours culminate in a final quarterly Demo Day where students present their projects and recieve recognition from VCs, industry leaders, and faculty.
                    Through Hackspace, we have collaborated with Microsoft Founder’s Hub where our members are able to access free compute credits for their projects and other special benefits. Hackspace also built a co-founder matching platform called Founder Pact that was a hit on campus last year. The team is planning to create a specialized cohort, providing members with a unique value-add to help them see their projects become a reality.
                    We hope to see you at the next HackerHours.
                    For more information, contact the VPs of Hackspace, Anish Chaudhuri (anishch@stanford.edu), Adarsh Ambati (adarsh1@stanford.edu), and Prady Saligram (prady@stanford.edu).
