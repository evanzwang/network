                              2024.06 - 2024.09
                                Designed a pipeline leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance domain-specific knowledge retrieval and automate the creation of security tests from STIGs, accelerating security profile delivery by 500%.
                                Utilized OpenAI API and LangChain's Chroma vector store, and custom embeddings to optimize context retrieval from various security resource documentations.
                            Software Development & DevSecOps Intern
                              2023.06 - 2023.09
                                Engineered an end-to-end DevSecOps pipeline for SAF using applications, libraries, and tools developed by MITRE and the security community. Hosted pipeline on EC2.
                                Automated pipeline for key tasks (hardening, validation, visualization) to inform platform owners of security risks and accelerate capability deployment in development, test, and production environments.
                                Presented and demonstrated the prototype pipeline directly to corporate partners and government sponsors, articulating intricate technical details while highlighting its operational benefits and simplicity.
                            Software Engineering Intern
                              2022.06 - 2022.09
                                Developed an initial, modern reimplementation for STIGViewer within Heimdall (a full-stack application for viewing security results). The backend uses PostgreSQL, JavaScript, and Typescript. The frontend uses Vue and Typescript.
                                Expanded the enterprise capabilities of Heimdall, a flagship application within the SAF, and validated/tested server-side Rest API calls to the Heimdall PostgreSQL database.
                              2021.06 - 2021.09
                                Authored the SAF CLI (Command Line Interface), a software that streamlines security automation for IT Systems and DevOps pipelines. The tool has over 25,000 downloads by the security community.
                                Created and published libraries to normalize outputs from various cybersecurity scanning tools into Heimdall Data Format (HDF) for various government sponsors and commercial partners.
