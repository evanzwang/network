                        Collin is a fourth year Computer Science major pursuing software engineering and entrepreneurship. Growing up, he had an addiction to video games like Minecraft and CS:GO, so it only made sense for him to stay glued to his computer as a career. He hopes to work in tech and possibly found his own company one day.
                        When Collin finds the time to touch grass, he enjoys playing sports with his friends like tennis, pickleball, volleyball, basketball, rock climbing, and weightlifting. In addition, spending time in the kitchen and cooking up new recipes is one of his favorite pastimes. Collin rushed AKPsi the first quarter of his freshman year, and it has been one of his best decisions in college. He is grateful to have joined an uplifting and welcoming family of intelligent and lively individuals.
