      Hi! I'm an undergrad at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science.
      My Current Interests Include:
        Neural Network Intepretability
        Reinforcement Learning
        Code Generation
        Interwar Eastern Europe
        Fresh Expo Markers
      I currently spend my time researching at
        [BAIR](https://bair.berkeley.edu/)
        . I also work on creative ML projects 
        with friends in
        [Launchpad](https://launchpad.berkeley.edu/)
        and explore cryptography with friends in
        [Blockchain at Berkeley](https://blockchain.studentorg.berkeley.edu/)
        .
        Previously, I've worked at
        [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/dataai/)
        on post-training, code generation, and agents, and in a couple groups within Berkeley's
        [SkyLab](https://sky.cs.berkeley.edu/)
        on consensus and distributed systems.
