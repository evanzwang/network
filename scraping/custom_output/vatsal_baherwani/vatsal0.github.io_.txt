                  I'm an undergrad student at the University of Maryland, graduating in 2025.
                  This summer I will join the
                    [Center for Human-Compatible AI](https://humancompatible.ai/)
                    as a research fellow.

                  Research
                  I am interested in making AI more accessible, interpretable, and trustworthy. This includes:
                    Exploring computationally efficient architectures and training methods for LLMs
                    Understanding how and where knowledge is represented in neural networks
                    Ensuring AI models adhere to specific rules and act toward human-aligned interests
                    Video Diffusion Models Encode Motion in Early Timesteps

                <a href="">arXiv</a>
                  We show that motion information is independently learned in early timesteps of the diffusion process, prior to the materialization of spatial attributes. We use this insight to present a simple and efficient method for targeted video motion customization.
                    Dense Backpropagation Improves Routing for Sparsely-Gated Mixture-of-Experts

                  NeurIPS 2024 OPT, ENLSP, Neural Compression Workshops
                  We approximate the dense backward pass of a sparse mixture-of-experts model, leading to improved training stability and performance with negligible overhead.
                    Racial and Gender Stereotypes Encoded Into CLIP Representations

                  ICLR 2024 Tiny Paper
                  We demonstrate that image and text embeddings in CLIP exhibit strong biases corresponding to prevalent racial and gender stereotypes.
