                        Three-dimensional modeling for engineering design.  This course will emphasize the use of CAD on computer workstations as a major graphical analysis and design tool.  Students develop design skills, and practice applying these skills. A group design project, design and fabrication (3D print) of the tower and rotor is required.  Hands-on creativity, teamwork, and effective communication are emphasized.
                          Repeat Rules
                          Course is not repeatable for credit.
