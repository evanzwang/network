                          As a postdoctoral scholar at the Stanford Center for Biomedical Informatics Research, I find myself at the exciting intersection of machine learning and healthcare. My journey began with a PhD in Biomedical Sciences from KU Leuven in Belgium, where I delved into the complexities of machine learning algorithms and their transformative potential in healthcare settings. My research, particularly focused on adapting these algorithms for time-to-event data (a method used for predicting specific events in a patient’s future), has not only been a challenging endeavor but also a deeply fulfilling one.

                          Dr. Vaidehi Natu is a developmental neuroscientist. Her research program aims to study how the human brain matures from infancy to adulthood, as it acquires new life skills and behaviors: What are the origins of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of brain development during infancy? How does the trajectory of neural mechanisms unfold during development, as school-aged children acquire complex skills such as reading or face recognition? What are some of the parallels in brain development across primate species? What changes occur in the brain in developmental disorders such as autism, multiple sclerosis, and dyslexia?

                          My long-term scientific goal entails establishing an interdisciplinary and diverse laboratory  focused on mitigating antibiotic resistance. My research comprises three central elements: elucidating the bacterial calcium transduction pathway, biosurfactants for treating deep tissue infections, and understanding how calcium signaling regulates bacterial pathogenesis mechanisms.

                          My research interests lie at the intersection of genetics and epigenetics, with a current focus on cancer and drug development. I am particularly interested in bifunctional small molecules, such as Transcriptional/Epigenetic Chemical Inducers of Proximity (TCIPs). My work now concentrates on designing, synthesizing, and testing new TCIPs that utilize various transcription factors or histone modifiers to target genes implicated in different types of cancer. Through this approach, I aim to develop innovative therapies that can more precisely and effectively combat cancer, especially to ease the treatment process for vulnerable patients, such as children and adolescents.
