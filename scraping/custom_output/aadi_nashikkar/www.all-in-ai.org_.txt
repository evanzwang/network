    ======= About Us Section =======
          About Us
            The goal of All In AI is to inspire a diverse community of
                students to consider a future in AI. The course seeks to empower
                students with the acquisition of technical knowledge and
                project-based application. All In AI supports instruction in
                high school classes, clubs, and career fairs. Options for a
                summer camp and online course are also in development.
                Peer-to-peer learning is part of the process, where students who
                have already taken the course can give back, teaching the course
                in the future.
