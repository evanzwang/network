                              Having first registered with the Academy aged eight, Jacob’s long association with City continued following his progression to sign a scholarship in July 2022.
                              Strong at breaking up play and intelligent in his distribution as a defensive midfielder, Jacob moved to the Under-18s squad for 2022/23 where he made 31 appearances in all competitions.
                              For the 2023/24 campaign, Wright progressed to the EDS squad and made 30 appearances, including his first-team debut in our FA Cup win over Huddersfield and a UEFA Champions League appearances against Copenhagen.
                              Wright’s season ended with an injury but returned ready to be a key member of the EDS squad for the 2024/25 season.
                              Having again impressed, he will now spend the second half of the 2024/25 campaign on loan at Championship side Norwich City.
