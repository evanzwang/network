                Dr.
                  serves as professor of Hebrew Bible at Candler
                  and as an associate faculty member at the Center for the Study of Law and Religion at Emory.
                  Prior to coming to Candler in 2007, Wright taught for several years at the University of Heidelberg, one of Europe’s oldest universities, renowned for biblical scholarship.
                  He is the author of many essays, articles, and books.
                  His first book,
                  Rebuilding Identity: The Nehemiah Memoir and Its Earliest Readers
                  (de Gruyter, 2004), won a 2008 Templeton prize, the largest prize for first books in religion. Wright published his enhanced e-book,
                  King David and His Reign Revisited
                  with Apple iTunes (2013), billed as the first publication of its kind in the humanities. His book,
                  David, King of Israel, and Caleb in Biblical Memory
                  (Cambridge Univ. Press, 2014), received an honorable mention at the 2015 PROSE Awards, administered by the Association of American Publishers,
                  as well as the coveted The Nancy Lapp Popular Book Award from American Schools of Oriental Research. Wright’s most recent book,
                    Why the Bible Began: An Alternative History of Scripture and Its Origins
                    , has won multiple awards, including the 2024 PROSE Award, and was included in The New Yorker’s “Best Books we read in 2023.”
                  Wright has developed a highly popular MOOC (massive open online course) through Coursera entitled:
                    [The Bible’s Prehistory, Purpose, and Political Future](https://www.coursera.org/learn/bible-history)
                    . More than 60,000 students have enrolled in the six-week course since it launched in 2014.
                  Wright delivered the prestigious 2010-11 lecture in
                    Milieux biblique
                    at the Collège de France in Paris, and was awarded a 2011-12 National Endowment for the Humanities Fellowship. In 2015, he received a $50,000 Templeton Foundation grant to underwrite a new research project with the Herzl Institute in Jerusalem, which will examine the highly developed discourse regarding the knowledge of God in the Hebrew Bible, as well as comparative work with the New Testament.
                  Wright has been named to Emory’s Faculty of Distinction, and is a member of Young Israel of Toco Hills in Atlanta.
