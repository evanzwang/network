                                  Secretary
                                  My name is Sarah Szalai and I am enjoying contributing to the MAVLI board in the Secretary position. I have been on the board since 2016, first spending two terms as co-chair in the PR portfolio and also as Acting Secretary for one year. My goal while in this portfolio is to execute my duties efficiently and timely, maintaining clear communication between the MAVLI board and MAVLI membership. Since graduating from the AEIP in 2017 I have primarily been working in the Video Relay Service setting and I enjoy the challenge that each day brings.

                                  Hi there! I have been an interpreter for four years now and I am loving learning new things and meeting new people all the time. The life of an interpreter is never boring and that's what I love about it! I am married and have two children. I was born and raised here in Winnipeg and I love our city. This is my first term on the MAVLI board.
