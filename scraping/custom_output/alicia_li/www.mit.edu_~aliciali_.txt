          Adversarial Attacks against Online Learning Agents
        2022-2023 MIT PRIMES research project. I constructed adversarial streaming algorithms against Epsilon-Greedy and Epsilon-Annealing 
                    sampling victims. I proved theoretical guarantees for the performance of these algorithms and coded them in Python.
          Play To Donate
        I made an app that lets people donate to charity when they play my games by leveraging ad revenue!
          Watch To Donate
        I created the first and only nonprofit student organization that enables people to donate without using any of their money by utilizing ad revenue from social media videos, mobile apps (iOS & Android),
                    and collaborations with artists and businesses.
