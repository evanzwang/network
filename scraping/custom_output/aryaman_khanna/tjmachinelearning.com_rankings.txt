      <p>For the first time ever, we have connected with data science professors at GMU and the EDIT internship team (a digital pathology + machine learning focused internship) who have agreed to acknowledge TJ Machine Learning Club rankings in their decision making. The top Machine Learning Club participants will also be able to obtain a Slingshot internship without going through the standard application process!</p>
