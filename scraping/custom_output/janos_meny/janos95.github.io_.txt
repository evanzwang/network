    About Me
        Hello! I'm Janos Meny, a mathematician who turned programmer, specializing in geometry processing, optimization, and computer graphics. I studied mathematics at the University of Bonn, focusing on algebraic geometry in my bachelor's and PDE-constrained optimization in my master's. Currently, I'm working at
          [Roblox](https://www.roblox.com)
          on realtime, fully networked solid modeling tools and geometry processing algorithms. Previously, I was at
          [nTop](https://ntop.com)
          , working on implicit modeling and latticing tools for high performance 3D printing applications.
    Interests
    I am broadly interested in various fields, including:
      Computational Geometry
      Computer Graphics
      Numerical Optimization
      Robotics
      Compilers and Programming Languages
      Applied Mathematics
    Projects
    A few projects I've worked on:
        [Mantis](https://github.com/Janos95/mantis)
      A blazing fast, SIMD-accelerated implementation for computing distance to triangle mesh.
        [Phasefield](https://github.com/Janos95/Phasefields)
      A phasefield-based optimization framework for 3D surface segmentation.
