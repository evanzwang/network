                        How to disable the very little-known AT&T setting that can appear to hijack your home DNS lookups and redirect to 104.239.207.44
                            Issue
                          DNS queries on home network suddenly resolving hosts to 104.239.207.44.
                            Symptoms
                          You will see SPORADIC mis-resolutions of EVERYTHING to thatÂ 104.239.207.44 address if their crappy router happens to hear your PC's DHCP request - EVEN IF ANOTHER DHCP SERVER ON THE NETWORK assigns the ultimate address.
