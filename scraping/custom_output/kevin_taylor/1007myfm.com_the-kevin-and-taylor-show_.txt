                            The Kevin & Taylor Show
                            Weekdays 2pm-6pm
                              What a gift to hang out with Kevin and Taylor listeners, the best people in the world, every day! On the “Kevin & Taylor Show,” we try to share the “welcoming heart of God” while having “Good, Clean, Fun.”
                              The Kevin and Taylor Show is a safe place to hang out, a judgment-free zone where we can do life together, laugh at ourselves, and lighten the load of everyday life.
                              The Kevin & Taylor show is one of the longest-running morning shows ever. Sometimes we must pinch ourselves, we’re so grateful we get to do this for a living in the city we love,
                              When we’re not on the air, you’ll spot us both hanging out with our families, Kevin on the green belt riding his road bike, or Taylor falling off her mountain bike in the foothills.
                              We can’t thank you enough for being part of this show. We love when you call, when you come to events, and catching up with us on social media after the show.
