          Thaman
          I’m Kushal (pronounced
            /kʊʃəl/
            ), an undergrad at Stanford studying Computer Science. Previously, I worked on the
            [science of neural network training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03096)
            at
            [STAIR](https://stair.cs.stanford.edu/)

            [adversarial attacks](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Le7fswY1lj)
            [CAIS](https://safe.ai/)
            , and now think about in-context learning & build new LM architectures at
            [Stanford NLP](https://nlp.stanford.edu/people/)
            , supervised by Prof.
            [Chris Manning](https://nlp.stanford.edu/~manning/)
            and Prof.
            [Chris Potts](https://stanford.edu/~cgpotts/)
            .
          In my spare time, I like to do
            to make the world feel a bit more mythic, swim, think about culture & endogenous growth theory, and counter my perpetual
