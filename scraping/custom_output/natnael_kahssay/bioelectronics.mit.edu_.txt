          Bioelectronics Group
          Welcome to the
            Bioelectronics
            Group at MIT.
          Our lab works at the interface of materials science, electronics, and neurobiology with the goal of advancing the understanding and treatment of disorders of the nervous system.
We design, synthesize, and fabricate optoelectronic and magnetic devices that manipulate and record neuronal activity and development.
          Research Topics
                    [Area I: Magnetic manipulation and recording of neuronal signaling with nanomaterials](/research/1.magnetic-transducers/)
                    [Area II: Multifunctional interfaces with central and peripheral nervous systems](/research/2.multifunctional-fibers/)
                    [Area III: Contributions of peripheral organ signaling to brain function and behavior](/research/3.fiber-based-devices/)
