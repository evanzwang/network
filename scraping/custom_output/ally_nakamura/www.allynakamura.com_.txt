            Hi, I'm Ally Nakamura :)
            I’m a Stanford new grad in SF, originally from the DMV and Tokyo. I love everything healthcare and am currently working on helping medical device companies deploy AI to make their workflows easier. On weekends you can find me hiking, going to new DJ sets, eating sushi, or playing poker with friends.
            About Me
              I’m working on
                [Catapult](https://trycatapult.ai/)
                through
                [PearX](https://pear.vc/pearx/)
                .
              I was previously at Instagram,
                [DoNotPay](https://donotpay.com/)
                , and the National Institutes of Health.
              I’m a
                [Softbank Masason Scholar](https://masason-foundation.org/en/)
              I have a BS/MS in CS(AI) from Stanford.
              I was a TA for Stanford’s (best imo) intro to programming and data structures
                [class](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs106b/)
                !
            Past Side Quests
              I worked with Stanford’s Open Virtual Assistant Lab to build EHR-Xamine: a virtual assistant for electronic clinical health records. We reduced physician burnout by making it easier and faster to interpret patient records.
              @ DoNotPay, I led an AI-enabled email client, featured by
                [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/curtissilver/2020/10/07/donotpay-launches-donotpay-email-so-you-dont-have-to-pay-via-email/)
                and
                [Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/donotpay-unsubscribe-spam-class-action/)
              I built a
                [voice agent](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gjG5WI-h4gLKo3xx8C4-QX8eWyBhogec/view?usp=drive_link)
                to automatically handle reference checks for healthcare staffing agencies.
              I also love hackathons and have built AI dating apps (think of “Hang the DJ” from Black Mirror – we simulated first dates between agents to better curate matches) and launched the world’s first AI crypto coin ($DEVIN) that scaled to $15M mcap.
