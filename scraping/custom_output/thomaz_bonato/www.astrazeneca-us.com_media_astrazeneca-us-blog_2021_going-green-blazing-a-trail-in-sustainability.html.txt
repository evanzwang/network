                  Going green: Blazing a trail in sustainability
                      PUBLISHED
                      16 September 2021
                      WRITTEN BY
                      Barbara Zuroick, US Fleet and Safety Manager for AstraZeneca
                      As a global biopharmaceutical company we have a responsibility to be industry leaders in positively impacting society and protecting the environment.
                      In January 2020, AstraZeneca announced its ‘
                          Ambition Zero Carbon
                          ’
                        plan to achieve zero carbon emissions from our operations by 2025 and to ensure our entire value chain is carbon negative by 2030, bringing forward decarbonization plans by more than a decade. We committed to invest $1 billion over the next ten years to deliver targets that are among the boldest in the industry.
                      Part of this ambitious strategy includes moving toward an entirely global fleet, operating on solely electric vehicles by 2025. This effort forms a key part of our overall sustainability strategy and moves us closer to our goal of sourcing 100% of our global electricity consumption from renewable sources by 2025 and reducing our carbon footprint.
                      We’re proud to have made significant progress toward our ambition over the past year, ranking#7 in the 2021
                          Top 50 Green Fleets
                        (up from #16 in 2019)and #1 in the pharmaceutical industry.
                      AstraZeneca operates a US fleet of approximately 5,000 SUVs and cars, including several light trucks. By the end of 2021 about 3,900 of these vehicles will be hybrid-electric vehicles. Additionally, we are introducing battery-electric vehicles (BEV) into our commercial fleet vehicle portfolio.
                        I can proudly say that AstraZeneca is leading the way in the path toward environmentally friendly vehicles in the US, which is beneficial not only for our environment, but society at large.
                        Barbara Zuroick
                          US Fleet and Safety Manager for AstraZeneca
                      There is a challenging learning curve associated with being among the few pharmaceutical companies prioritizing green vehicles. By creating and leveraging a strong industry network, we have been able to gather key learnings from other fleets in the industry and then implement an agile and strategy approach to achieve this green transition.
                        I am extremely proud of the work Barbara Zuroick and the team has done to advance our green fleet within AstraZeneca. This initiative affirms our long-term commitment to sustainability by reducing the carbon footprint with our fleet vehicle selection. Our continued advances in this space asserts our commitment to society, and helps us become a leader in sustainable business in the community— socially, economically and environmentally.
