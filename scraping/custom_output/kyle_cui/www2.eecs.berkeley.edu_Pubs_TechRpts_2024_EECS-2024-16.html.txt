        [http://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2024/EECS-2024-16.pdf](http://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2024/EECS-2024-16.pdf)
      Virtual reality (VR) is used to train psychomotor skills for domains both within VR, e.g. games, and beyond VR, e.g. sports and healthcare. Although it is a common practice to employ variations of tasks to train psychomotor skills, how to algorithmically predict psychomotor skill acquisition given the task variations, or a distribution, has not been investigated. To address this problem, we derive and adapt ideas from intelligent tutoring systems (ITS), a sub-field of learning sciences. We formally model and generate task distributions with physical constraints that are designed by instructors using a probabilistic programming language. We investigate the effectiveness of Bayesian knowledge tracing (BKT) from ITS to predict psychomotor skill acquisition. Our algorithm sequentially sample a task from a probabilistic program, generates it in VR, and updates the BKT prediction using the performance of a user on the task. We conduct a between subject study that compares BKT to self-prediction of skill acquisition. Our study shows that the experimental condition outperforms the control, and BKT contributes to much more consistent learning outcomes than self-prediction.
