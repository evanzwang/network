                              The films of Edward Yang (1947‚Äì2007) were among the first to capture the ethos of Taiwan‚Äôs rapid modernization‚Äîparticularly Taipei urbanites adjusting to their global city‚Äôs ever-evolving zeitgeist‚Äîeven as they exhibited a novelistic field of vision that superseded time and place. Born in Shanghai and brought to Taiwan by his family in 1949 after the end of the Chinese Civil War, Yang emerged in the early 1980s as a leading figure of the ascendant Taiwanese New Wave with his contribution to the seminal anthology film
                                In Our Time
                              (1982). He remained a cinematic guiding light of his country‚Äôs first postwar generation up to his magnum opus,
                              (2000, NYFF38). Grounding his films in a realist aesthetic‚Äîperhaps partly owed to his formal training as a computer engineer‚ÄîYang gracefully responded to the world‚Äôs changes across seven expansive features, each one notable for their sprawling, unconventional narrative structures, effortlessly precise compositions, and largely nonprofessional casts that expressed a heartfelt, near-omniscient understanding of life on the small island nation. Likening any one of his films to a ‚Äúvery intimate letter to a very good friend,‚Äù Yang defined the intricacies of interpersonal relationships (among different generations and classes) with a depth of storytelling and intimacy of style that call for multiple viewings to parse.
                              The retrospective is occasioned by
                              brand-new restorations of two of Yang‚Äôs rarely screened works:
                                Mahjong
                              (1996, NYFF34), whose new 4K restoration will have its world premiere as part of the series; and
                                A Confucian Confusion
                              (1994), which was both an NYFF32 Main Slate selection and an NYFF60 Revivals selection. Well overdue for a rerelease,
                              (2000, NYFF38), Yang‚Äôs final and most renowned film, will receive multiple screenings throughout the series. In addition to the groundbreaking anthology
                              (1982), which revitalized Taiwanese narrative cinema in the 1980s and includes Yang‚Äôs first work made for theatrical release, other highlights include several of Yang‚Äôs seldom-screened films:
                                That Day, on the Beach
                              (1983), his first theatrical feature film and one of the greatest debuts of the 20th century;
                                The Winter of 1905
                              (1982), directed by Yu Wei-cheng from Yang‚Äôs sensitive script; and Yang‚Äôs unfinished animated martial arts film
                                The Wind
                              (2002‚Äì2005), whose production was halted after his death.
                              These films, in addition to Yang‚Äôs widely beloved works such as
                              (1991),
                                Taipei Story
                              (1985), and
                                Terrorizers
                              (1986), offer audiences the rare chance to experience on the big screen the breadth of Yang‚Äôs work and his trajectory as an artist, from a screenwriter to his theatrical debut as a director to the projects leading up to his death that remain unfinished but hint at what could have been. The series comes more than a decade after the last retrospective of Yang‚Äôs work in New York, which was also presented by Film at Lincoln Center in 2011.
                                Presented with the support of Janus Films. Organized by Florence Almozini and Tyler Wilson.

                            Before he turned his attention to directing, Edward Yang contributed the screenplay to this rarely screened period piece starring legendary Hong Kong action director Tsui Hark (
                            Peking Opera Blues
                            ) as the great Chinese artist and Buddhist monk Li Shutong, aka Master Hong.

                            , was presented as the second short of this anthology film which revitalized Taiwanese narrative cinema in the 1980s and established a break from decades of rigidly conservative movies entrenched in the local industry. Screening with Yang's unfinished final work

                                  Hokkien, Mandarin, German, and English with English subtitles
                            Edward Yang‚Äôs first theatrical feature film (which also marked the debut of the cinematographer Christopher Doyle) is a visually and emotionally arresting melodrama of fractured romance, disaffection, and the intergenerational breakdown felt across Taiwan in the 1980s.
                                  1985
                                  Hokkien and Mandarin with English subtitles
                            Framed in precisely calibrated compositions of urban anonymity and featuring a nonprofessional cast that Edward Yang hoped would reflect the city as he and friends experienced it firsthand,
                            is a psychologically rich character drama realized through the prism of social critique.
                                  1986
                                  Taiwan/Hong Kong

                            A complexly layered, self-reflexive puzzle film,
                            is at once Edward Yang‚Äôs ultimate statement on the isolation of modern living and a road map through his own formidable creative process.
                                  1994
