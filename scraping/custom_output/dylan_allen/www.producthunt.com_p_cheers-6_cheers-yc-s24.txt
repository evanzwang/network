                                Cheers
                            üìå
                            üëã Hey Product Hunt! I‚Äôm Dylan Allen, and Ernesto Valencia and I are building Cheers. We just moved to SF from Utah (got into
                              [@ycombinator](https://www.producthunt.com/@ycombinator)
                              ), and we‚Äôre stoked to share what we've been working on with you.

üöÄ Cheers is different from your typical digital business card. We‚Äôve built NFC-enabled employee badges that do more than just share contact info‚Äîthey directly connect each interaction to the individual employee.

üí° For example, imagine a hospice worker verifying their identity with a quick tap, or a door-to-door sales rep being accountable for being too pushy. This allows businesses to gather feedback, verify employment, and capture leads effortlessly.

By focusing on the employee level, we help improve the customer experience and ensure the right people get recognized for their work.

We‚Äôre just getting started, but we're building toward creating the go-to platform for in-person teams, where every interaction is seamless and adds value for both the employee and the business.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts and answering any questions. Cheers to better interactions! ü•Ç

                            This is one of those rare solutions that come out of nowhere and make you think, ‚Äúwhy hasn‚Äôt this existed before?‚Äù 

This is an area ready to be upset by some innovators and Dylan and Ernesto are crushing it.

                            Hi, I love your homepage and your product presentation. 

How much value does backed by Y Combinator add? it takes up a lot of valuable space
To me it's not "And Trusted by  Businesses Including" it's "Trusted by  Businesses Including" 
I want to know who is using it not who is investing in it but I could be wrong
                              [@userinsite](https://www.producthunt.com/@userinsite)
                              This is really helpful, and a really good point. I'll switch up the wording, as those are all businesses using Cheers!
                              Looks much better! Let me know if need more insight, I am building up my resume as a product tester/analyst

                            Hey Dylan,

I'm curious about the security aspects. How do you protect employee and customer data collected through the NFC interactions? 

Have you considered expanding into other industries beyond sales and healthcare?

Congrats on the launch!

                              Hey Alexander, I think Cheers will be most useful to the types of businesses that do most of their job outside of a specific place of business, like plumbers, electricians, field sales, hospice workers, etc. We're helping customers across all sorts of different industries right now, and everyone has been loving it!
                              I'd also love to hear your thoughts on what you think it could be most useful in!

                              Thanks for the comment Zach! Being able to do different customer actions like leave a review or verify employment (or ask for a quote, etc.) benefit businesses like Healthcare workers, plumbers, electricians, window washers, and basically any business who does the majority of their business in-person!
