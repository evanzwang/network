            Cheers: The super-app for in-person employees
            [See original launch post ‚Ä∫](/launches/LbZ-cheers-the-super-app-for-in-person-employees)
                TL;DR:
                We‚Äôre
                , building the super-app for in-person employees (think home services, restaurants, D2D sales). We‚Äôre starting with NFC-enabled employee badges that make key tasks‚Äîlike collecting reviews and verifying employment‚Äîseamless. It‚Äôs our first step toward becoming the central platform for in-person work.
                ü•Ç What is Cheers?
                Cheers is on a mission to revolutionize how in-person employees work.
                We‚Äôre building the super-app that will become the central hub for everything these employees need‚Äîfrom managing schedules and tracking performance to accepting tips and capturing customer feedback‚Äîall through NFC technology pre-enabled on smartphones today.
                üß® The Problem We Solve:
                In-person customer and employee interactions are often inefficient and filled with friction.
                Whether it‚Äôs collecting feedback, verifying employment, or capturing leads, these processes are typically slow, manual, and prone to errors. This inefficiency not only frustrates employees and customers
                but also leads to missed opportunities for businesses to optimize and grow.
              Check out how it looks here:
                [https://youtu.be/yfW_QonAPEE](https://youtu.be/yfW_QonAPEE)
                Cheers aims to make every in-person interaction seamless, frictionless, and measurable.
                We‚Äôre starting with NFC-enabled employee badges that go beyond basic identification. These badges enable employees to perform key actions with just a tap‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs gathering a 5-star Google Review, collecting a lead, or verifying employment‚Äîright when it matters most, face-to-face with the customer.
                üöÄ Why We‚Äôre Excited About Cheers:
              We believe that these badges are our wedge into businesses. They address immediate needs (better Google Reviews, etc.) while laying the groundwork for something much bigger.
                As employees and owners tap into Cheers‚Äô early features, they quickly see the value in capturing and attributing customer interactions to individual employees.
                That means the right employees get the proper credit and feedback, which is actionable at a more granular level. We‚Äôve already seen this open the door to deeper integration across operations.
                (
                  also, Apple
                  made an announcement about
                  iOS 18.1
                  that really excites us, check it out
                      here
                  .)
                Example:
                Imagine an employee tapping their badge to allow a customer to leave a 5-star Google Review in just 3 taps: notification, rating, post. Or, picture a customizable employee page where customers can perform multiple actions‚Äîlike booking services or leaving feedback‚Äîall in one place.
                üìà Our Traction:
              We have 25 customers, the majority of which are small businesses, like your local bridal shop or burger joint. We have one enterprise-level client with whom we‚Äôve been running a successful paid pilot for the past 2 months.
                We‚Äôve grown our MRR from ~$1,400 on July 1st to ~$4,000 now.
                Cheers has already processed over 3,000 internal and external reviews for our customers.
              Our reporting software is delivering real results‚Äî
                our average customer has 5-10x‚Äôed their monthly 5-star Google Reviews.
                Managers are using it to track performance, run competitions, and provide targeted feedback.
                (See the screenshot below for a look at what our customers do when hosting competitions).
                But this is just the start.
                We‚Äôre building Cheers to be the central operating system for in-person businesses‚Äîa platform that will transform how in-person teams operate, from scheduling and payments to customer engagement and beyond.
                üôè Our Ask to You:
              We‚Äôre looking for intros to folks who manage‚Äîor know someone who manages‚Äîin-person, customer-facing teams: anything from self-storage to solar sales. Cheers is
                especially
                helpful for companies that currently struggle with getting online reviews (Google, TripAdvisor, Thumbtack, etc.).
              Our first product, the Cheers NFC-enabled employee badge, is already delivering strong results, and with your help, we can build something truly impactful. Request a text from one of us, or schedule a call with our CEO Dylan,
                .
              And finally, a toast, to people like you. Cheers! ü•Ç
