                                  Revolutionizing Healthcare AI with Solo
                                The healthcare industry faces a unique set of challenges when adopting AI, particularly around data privacy, accessibility, and customization. Patient data must remain secure and confidential, making traditional cloud-based AI solutions risky. Additionally, healthcare providers often operate in remote or low-connectivity environments where consistent internet access isnâ€™t guaranteed. To truly transform patient care, AI needs to be not just intelligent but also adaptable to specific healthcare scenarios.
