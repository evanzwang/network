              Catherine Lee is associate professor in the Department of Sociology and faculty associate at the Institute for Health, Health Care Policy, and Aging Research at Rutgers University. Professor Lee's research focuses on the meaning of race, gender, and inequality across three critical sites: immigration, health and medicine, and law and society. Specifically, her published books and articles examine the history of Asian America, racism, immigration restriction, and family reunification in American immigration; the role of genetic testing and other technologies in immigration control; and legal and administrative uses of racial categories in the criminal justice system and biomedicine. She is the author of Fictive Kinship: Family Reunification and the Meaning of Race and Nation in American Immigration and co-editor of Genetics and the Unsettled Past: The Collision of DNA, Race, and History.
