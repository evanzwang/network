          [Stanford Applied Cryptography group](https://crypto.stanford.edu/)
      I work in the Security Engineering and Architecture (SEAR) group at
        , on
        TLS and related internet technologies.
      I previously co-founded
        with
        [Neil
            Movva](https://www.neilmovva.com/)
        .
        We worked on running LLMs in hardware enclaves, and
        on an
        [SDK](https://github.com/blyssprivacy/sdk)
        for private information retrieval.
      Before that, I was a software engineer at
        , where I worked on secure
        device manufacturing and programming.
      I've also done research in homomorphic encryption and private information retrieval.

      Background
      I got my B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science in 2019 from Stanford University; my tracks were Systems and Computer
        & Network Security. While there, I was a TA for Prof. Dan Boneh's
        [CS 255 (cryptography)](https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/courses/cs255_winter19/)
        and
        [CS 251 (blockchain)](http://cs251crypto.stanford.edu/18au-cs251/)
        classes. I also did research in
        the Applied Cryptography group on
        [speeding up lattice-based
            SNARKs](https://github.com/dwu4/lattice-snarg)
