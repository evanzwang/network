Consequently, the resulting unknown unknowns are likely to be concentrated in certain portions of the feature space (and not randomly). We also assume that the features which are informative enough to distinguish between ..."

We create such policies by leveraging a large number of training examples that are generated using a physical simulator. Our system is made of two components: a Universal Policy (UP) and a function for Online System Identification (OSI). We describe our control policy as universal ..."

Once an accurate DNN model for the evolution operator is constructed, it serves as a predictive model for the unknown ..."
