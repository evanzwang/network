                  Introduction
                We are Gordon and Rez, two recent graduates who spent a lot of the past year moving into our new apartments. Throughout this process, we have spent countless hours researching new monitors, webcams, and vacuum cleaners (anything to keep our home office setup as tidy as possible, really!). And here’s what we noticed:
                  ❌ Problem: Finding your ideal product is hard.
                    Information Overload:
                    from one google search for best monitors or headphones, you have to click on ten different articles just to understand the scope.
                    Research is not personalized.
                    There’s no filter for certain specs on Google, nor a chat function for follow-up questions and iterative suggestions.
                    SEO Spam:
                    Online articles are often written to boost engagement, and Amazon reviews are filled with advertisers trying to make a living.
                We understand how arduous this may be, and we’re looking forward to making your lives easier.
                  ✅ Solution:
                    [kart.ai](http://kart.ai)
                    turns hours of research into minutes!
                      Ask natural queries:
                      Setting up your work-from-home office? Trying to find the best headphones for your post-work gym session? We’ll answer all these questions and any follow-ups you may have.
                      Aggregated reviews and listings:
                      Like a product you see? Click on a product card, and we will list out all the pros and cons. There’s more: we analyze reviews across Reddit and Amazon, then find all the best deals for you. We make sure to retrieve information from sites you trust, such as Rtings, Reddit, Wirecutter, etc.
                      Share with your friends:
                      Want to ask your family for advice? Buying a new mini-fridge with a roommate together? All conversations have a unique link that you can share at the click of a button. We’ll showcase all our favorite ones on the blog.
