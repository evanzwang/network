  "main_content": "Janos Meny About Me Hello! I'm Janos Meny, a mathematician who turned programmer, specializing in geometry processing, optimization, and computer graphics. I studied mathematics at the University of Bonn, focusing on algebraic geometry in my bachelor's and PDE-constrained optimization in my master's. Currently, I'm working at Roblox on realtime, fully networked solid modeling tools and geometry processing algorithms. Previously, I was at nTop , working on implicit modeling and latticing tools for high performance 3D printing applications. Interests I am broadly interested in various fields, including: Computational Geometry Computer Graphics Numerical Optimization Robotics Compilers and Programming Languages Applied Mathematics Projects A few projects I've worked on: Mantis A blazing fast, SIMD-accelerated implementation for computing distance to triangle mesh. Phasefield A phasefield-based optimization framework for 3D surface segmentation. Contact If you'd like to discuss math, technology, or any interesting projects, feel free to reach out to me.
