  "main_content": "Here are some things I\u2019ve worked on. 94 MHz RISC-V CPU Designed a pipelined processor in SystemVerilog for the RISC-V ISA Used P6 style renaming, an N-way superscalar design, early tag broadcast, early branch resolution, and GShare branch prediction. Also incorporated instruction prefetching, non-blocking instruction and data caches (N-way set-associative and banked, respectively), a victim cache, and a load-store queue with forwarding. Achieved a clock frequency of ~94MHz and an average CPI of 1.7 on a suite of programs including GNU libraries, Alexnet, sorting algorithms, and geometric functions. s/o Bradley , Miah , Arjun , Sunny , and Jack . Report . Roll Over Beethoven: A Cloth Piano A foldable, portable piano/keyboard. Comprises the core instrument with cloth keys (on foldable card paper), a graphics display (for feedback and tutorials), and a sustain pedal. Wrote drivers for the sensors and display, synthesized different timbres, and created a tutorial in C . Code . Formal Verification of FtTokenCMP Formally verified FtTokenCMP , a fault-tolerant, token-based cache coherence protocol using Murphi . Code . EECS 270 RTL DV Autograder As a TA, co-developed testing frameworks in Verilog , set up Docker environments, and wrote testbenches to verify student FPGA designs. Deployed on autograder.io, and used by every computer engineering student at Michigan (~300/semester). FPGA Design Projects Four function calculator, traffic lights controller, and carry lookahead adder. Deployed and verified on Altera DE2-115 boards. Robotic Planning and Controls Projects iLQR implementation in Pytorch for the inverted double-pendulum on a cart. MPC and MPPI for linearizing cartpole and robot arm dynamics. Dynamics from state measurements, with Gaussian processes. Misc C/C++ Projects RISC-V assembler, simulator, linker Pipeline and cache simulators in C Tarjan\u2019s pairing heap SQL-like relational database Among Us simulator with optimal TSP Seam-carving for image resizing Piazza posts classifier Plants vs Zombies simulator Euchre simulator",
