Working across literature, media, and political history, I am interested in how Cold War frameworks collide with the aftermaths of decolonization through figures of time, economy, and emergency, amongst others. At Brown, I\u2019ve held fellowships from the Cogut Institute for the Humanities and the Center for Contemporary South Asia. I was previously an editorial fellow at The Atlantic , and an editor at PIX , a photography publication based in New Delhi, where I worked on multiple curatorial projects as well. \"The After of the Already Too Late\": Cinema, Time, and Third World Solidarity in Naeem Mohaiemen\u2019s The Young Man Was .
