His planned dissertation project examines the politics of temporality with reference to 20th-century South Asia in a transnational frame. Working across literature, photography, and film, he examines practices of citizenship, subjectivity, and diaspora as articulated alongside decolonial movements. He has also taught courses on graphic novels and academic writing at Brown. Previously, he was an editorial fellow at The Atlantic, and an associate editor at PIX, a photography publication based in New Delhi, where he worked on multiple curatorial projects as well. He holds a B.A. in literary studies from Middlebury College.",
