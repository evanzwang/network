  "main_content": "Hi! I\u2019m Andrew, and I am a third-year undergraduate at Stanford University studying computer science and mathematics. I grew up in Seattle and Hong Kong and enjoy solving puzzles, playing piano (current favorite: Liszt), and hiking with my dog . I also like to write down things of interest \u2013 or of no interest \u2013 in my blog . In particular, some fields I enjoy learning about include neural architectures, human-computer interaction, probability/combinatorics, metacognition, and learning theory. I am currently involved in several projects that lie at the heart of the intersections of these topics (see publications ), including: Founding quant[at]CWRU , a student-led research group supported by professors Shuai Xu and Vipin Chaudhary focused on integrating current paradigms in machine learning to solve complex financial tasks. Reducing post hoc error rates in low-precision language models with Professor Zhaozhuo Xu . Designing pruning and knowledge editing algorithms for convolutional and graph neural networks with Reseachers at Rice AI and MIT . Broadly, some questions in AI that I am interested in addressing include: How can we ensure that the systems we build are faithful and secure? Models improve with size, yet they are often overparameterized and inefficient. How do we effectively balance this scale-bloat tradeoff? How do neural networks fundamentally reason, think, and learn ? On that topic, where do we draw the line for artificial general intelligence as it grows nearer? In the past, I\u2026 Taught data analytics and statistics at DigiPen Institute of Technology. Worked with Angel Alban to create better healthcare systems as an intern for Zventus . Did the first half of my undergrad education at Case Western Reserve University.",
