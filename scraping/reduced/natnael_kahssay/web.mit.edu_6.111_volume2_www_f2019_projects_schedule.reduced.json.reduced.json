We'll go over your checkoff milestones and each team member will have a chance to describe and demonstrate their portion of the project. With your permission, we'd like to shoot a couple minutes of video the next day to showcase you and your project on the course website. Please be sure to be on time (eg, by arriving 5 minutes early!). In order to be fair to everyone, we'll be running a tight ship schedule- wise, so please help us keep to the schedule. You may switch times with other teams if mutually agreeable.

Three person team will be allocated 12 minutes for the presentation followed by a 2 minute QA. Two person teams will be allocated 8 minutes with a 2 minute QA. Single person team will have 5 minutes with a 2 minute QA. In fairness to the presentors, the time limit will enforced. The presentation should be 6-12 slides that include an overview, a block diagram, discussion of the major modules identifying the tricky bits or implementation insights, and a simple timeline showing what you expect to have working when. Each team member should give part of the presentation. You're welcome to use whatever tool you'd like to create the presentation: HTML with figures, Powerpoint, PDF, etc. Please format the material so that it can be projected properly, i.e., it should be in landscape format. Your presentation must be loaded on a flash drive for projection on my laptop. Individual laptops will not be allowed. This saves times and avoids compatibility issues with the projector as well internet connectivity issues. We have a lot of presentations, so please plan to start and end at the appointed times. Practice your presentation to ensure that it will fit into your time slot. Please upload a PDF of your presentation slides so that they can be posted on the course website.",
