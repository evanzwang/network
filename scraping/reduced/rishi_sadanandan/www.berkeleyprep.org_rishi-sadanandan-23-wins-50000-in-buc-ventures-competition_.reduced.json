After graduating from Berkeley, he founded a tech startup named PocketChange. The PocketChange app is designed to maximize the use of gift cards, and it will be launching (with help from Berkeley beta testers) in the near future! Click here to watch a video in which Rishi explains how the $50,000 BUC Ventures award will help take PocketChange to the next level. Rishi attends Stanford University and says Berkeley\u2019s lessons have stayed with him in both college and his entrepreneurial journey: \u201cYou just have to work hard and show up, and you can attain any opportunity. That\u2019s what Berkeley taught me: that I can be the one to do this. I have the confidence to know that I can change the world positively.\u201d BUC Ventures was created to provide students with hands-on experience with an investment fund focused on alumni businesses. We are grateful to our donor investors, who provided the capital to launch this important experiential learning opportunity. BUC Ventures is part of the Lasher Center for Business and Entrepreneurial Studies .
