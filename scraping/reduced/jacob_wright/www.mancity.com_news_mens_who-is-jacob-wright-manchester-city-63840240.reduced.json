  "main_content": "Jacob Wright is the latest member of Manchester City's Elite Development Squad to make his senior debut for Pep Guardiola\u2019s men. The young midfielder came off the bench in our 5-0 triumph over Huddersfield Town in the FA Cup third round. A brace from Phil Foden, Julian Alvarez and Jeremy Doku strikes and an own goal ensured our latest defence of the competition got off to a flying start at the Etihad Stadium. It was a memorable afternoon all round for the FA Cup holders, with the victory also seeing Kevin De Bruyne and Doku return to action following lengthy injury lay-offs, with the pair combining for City\u2019s fifth and final goal. And Wright was introduced soon after that final strike, coming on for Mateo Kovacic with 15 minutes to play. The 18-year-old first registered with City\u2019s Academy at the age of eight, and he first signed a scholarship in July 2022. Over the course of the following campaign, he helped our Under-18s to a third consecutive Under-18 Premier League title, making 31 appearances in all competitions for Ben Wilkinson\u2019s side. CITY+ | SUBSCRIBE TO ACCESS EXCLUSIVE CONTENT Wright has since progressed to City\u2019s Elite Development Squad for 2023/24, grabbing a stunning late equaliser in November to earn Brian Barry-Murphy\u2019s side a last-gasp point in Premier League 2. A more defensive midfielder by trade, the youngster\u2019s positional intelligence and organisation means he excels at breaking up play, while his technical quality often acts as the attacking spark for our EDS. Congratulations to Jacob on making his senior Manchester City debut!
