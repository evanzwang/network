It is the latest step in the teenager\u2019s rising career as he makes the move to Carrow Road off the back of invaluable experiences working alongside Pep Guardiola\u2019s first-team squad on a regular basis since last summer. OneFootball Videos Having been first included in City\u2019s senior squad for the FIFA Club World Cup in Saudi Arabia back in December 2023, Wright made his senior debut for the club appearing from the substitute\u2019s bench in the FA Cup third round win over Huddersfield the following January. Later in the same season, Jacob Wright made his UEFA Champions League debut for the club as part of the last-16 victory over Copenhagen, while joining the club on their pre-season tour of the United States ahead of the ongoing season. However, in the ongoing campaign, Jacob Wright has only managed two appearances for Pep Guardiola\u2019s side despite their shortcomings in the defensive midfield position, featuring in the Carabao Cup third and fourth round ties against Watford and Tottenham respectively. As Jacob Wright completes his move to East Anglian-based Championship side Norwich City during the ongoing transfer window, here is everything you need to know about the deal! What are the terms of Jacob Wright\u2019s move to Norwich City from Manchester City? Jacob Wright has joined Championship side Norwich City on loan until the end of the season, while the Canaries have the option to make the move permanent in the summer for a \u00a35 million fee.

I\u2019m looking forward to getting into training tomorrow and the games will be coming thick and fast.\u201d What have Norwich City said about the completed deal?
