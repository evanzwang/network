Wood High) By Richard Bammer | rbammer@thereporter.com | Vacaville Reporter PUBLISHED: February 25, 2025 at 4:16 PM PST The first-ever Coach Jacob Wright Field Day event, to honor the late beloved football coach, will be held April 13 at Will C. Wood High campus, it has been announced. The two-hour celebration to honor Wright, who died in 2023, begins at 1 p.m. at the school, 998 Marshall Road, Vacaville. Wright\u2019s wife, sister, and friends are organizing the special event with a focus on the values he embraced during his life, organizers said in a press statement. The field day will feature a variety of activities that promote fun, laughter, family, community, fitness, and, of course, football. Other aspects include a fun run/walk, a children\u2019s play area, food trucks, community resources, swag, and a silent auction. Funds raised will go toward the creation of the Coach Jacob Wright Foundation. Its two biggest benefactors will be the Vacaville Jr. Wildcats Football Program and the Will C. Wood High School Football Program. Coach Wright was widely regarded as a pillar in the Vacaville Unified School District and the Vacaville community. His dedication to family, health, education, and football left an indelible mark on all who knew him. The field day event comes as the VUSD governing board recently unanimously voted to formally name the school\u2019s athletic field The Jacob Wright Memorial Field at Will C. Wood\u2019s Wildcat Stadium. Organizers are looking for those who would like to contribute to the cause with cash donations, sponsorships, equipment/supplies, and volunteering.
