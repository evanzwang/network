Dylan graduated from BYU with a degree in computer science, and originally hails from Dallas, Texas. Dylan Allen Cheers Company Launches Cheers: The super-app for in-person employees See original launch post \u203a TL;DR: We\u2019re Cheers , building the super-app for in-person employees (think home services, restaurants, D2D sales). We\u2019re starting with NFC-enabled employee badges that make key tasks\u2014like collecting reviews and verifying employment\u2014seamless. It\u2019s our first step toward becoming the central platform for in-person work. \ud83e\udd42 What is Cheers? Cheers is on a mission to revolutionize how in-person employees work. We\u2019re building the super-app that will become the central hub for everything these employees need\u2014from managing schedules and tracking performance to accepting tips and capturing customer feedback\u2014all through NFC technology pre-enabled on smartphones today. \ud83e\udde8 The Problem We Solve: In-person customer and employee interactions are often inefficient and filled with friction. Whether it\u2019s collecting feedback, verifying employment, or capturing leads, these processes are typically slow, manual, and prone to errors. This inefficiency not only frustrates employees and customers but also leads to missed opportunities for businesses to optimize and grow. Check out how it looks here: https://youtu.be/yfW_QonAPEE Cheers aims to make every in-person interaction seamless, frictionless, and measurable. We\u2019re starting with NFC-enabled employee badges that go beyond basic identification. These badges enable employees to perform key actions with just a tap\u2014whether it\u2019s gathering a 5-star Google Review, collecting a lead, or verifying employment\u2014right when it matters most, face-to-face with the customer. \ud83d\ude80 Why We\u2019re Excited About Cheers: We believe that these badges are our wedge into businesses. They address immediate needs (better Google Reviews, etc.) while laying the groundwork for something much bigger. As employees and owners tap into Cheers\u2019 early features, they quickly see the value in capturing and attributing customer interactions to individual employees. That means the right employees get the proper credit and feedback, which is actionable at a more granular level. We\u2019ve already seen this open the door to deeper integration across operations. ( also, Apple made an announcement about iOS 18.1 that really excites us, check it out here .) Example: Imagine an employee tapping their badge to allow a customer to leave a 5-star Google Review in just 3 taps: notification, rating, post. Or, picture a customizable employee page where customers can perform multiple actions\u2014like booking services or leaving feedback\u2014all in one place. \ud83d\udcc8 Our Traction: We have 25 customers, the majority of which are small businesses, like your local bridal shop or burger joint. We have one enterprise-level client with whom we\u2019ve been running a successful paid pilot for the past 2 months. We\u2019ve grown our MRR from ~$1,400 on July 1st to ~$4,000 now. Cheers has already processed over 3,000 internal and external reviews for our customers. Our reporting software is delivering real results\u2014 our average customer has 5-10x\u2019ed their monthly 5-star Google Reviews. Managers are using it to track performance, run competitions, and provide targeted feedback. (See the screenshot below for a look at what our customers do when hosting competitions). But this is just the start. We\u2019re building Cheers to be the central operating system for in-person businesses\u2014a platform that will transform how in-person teams operate, from scheduling and payments to customer engagement and beyond. \ud83d\ude4f Our Ask to You: We\u2019re looking for intros to folks who manage\u2014or know someone who manages\u2014in-person, customer-facing teams: anything from self-storage to solar sales. Cheers is especially helpful for companies that currently struggle with getting online reviews (Google, TripAdvisor, Thumbtack, etc.). Our first product, the Cheers NFC-enabled employee badge, is already delivering strong results, and with your help, we can build something truly impactful. Request a text from one of us, or schedule a call with our CEO Dylan, here . And finally, a toast, to people like you. Cheers! \ud83e\udd42",
