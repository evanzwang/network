In this work, we hypothesize that detected breathing patterns can be utilized to predict whether adequate MR image quality will be obtained. With a K-means clustering algorithm, 9 in 10 forty-second breathing waveforms were correctly predicted as either resulting in a high or low image quality image; this finding can save time from unnecessary scans. Other models achieved similar results as K-means clusterings. How to access this content: For one year after publication, abstracts and videos are only open to registrants of this annual meeting.
