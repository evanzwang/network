Twitter \u2014 GitHub \u2014 LinkedIn \u2014 touwenlourens[at]gmail.com Research Paper: Learning the mechanisms of network growth , L. Touwen, D. Bucur, R. van der Hofstad, A. Garavaglia, N. Litvak, Scientific Reports , 2024 \u2014 Nature.com MSc thesis: Triangle Count reveals Communities and improves Graph Neural Networks \u2014 Thesis We show that triangle count can be used to reveal communities in graphs, and that this information can be used to improve the power of GNNs on whole-graph tasks. I visited Toronto Metropolitan University for a research stay with Prof. Pawel Pralat. Some projects Scanned PDF To EPUB with GPT \u2014 Repository Script that converts a scanned PDF to EPUB, using GPT-4o for the character recognition. This is expensive (~1$/100 pages), but works significantly better than \"dumb\" OCR. The key idea is to also provide metadata in the prompt, deduced from earlier pages (title, author, chapter title, last paragraph). This way GPT-4o can infer the correct formatting of the given image. Data-mined political compass of the Dutch congressional chamber \u2014 Repository From Scribble To Readable \u2014 Webshop A notebook containing the guide to writing mathematical symbols like you're in kindergarten. This was my COVID summer project with Tristan Trouwen. Fun article about the whole thing. GPT as Markov Chain \u2014 Repository Can we model GPT as a Markov Chain, and obtain probability bounds on reaching \"naughty\" states? The answer is yes, but the dimension of the state space is too large to be practical. Team HART \u2014 Website University and industry funded team of ~18 students. We developed a sleeve that can give haptic feedback representing any type of information. The user learns to interpret these vibrations, effectively learning a new sense. Our first application allowed the user to understand a foreign language, in real time. I joined HART as the first generation in early 2021, and left in February 2022.
