We believe in training our scholars to pursue civic engagement through volunteer, outreach, and service activities so that the future of the IEOR profession can fully represent the diverse populations and contexts that surround us. K-12 Outreach Kids Teach Tech Kids Teach Tech (KTT) is a non-profit organization founded five years ago by Arjun Banerjee Mulchandani, the then 10-year-old son of Berkeley IEOR alumna Sarbani Banerjee Mulchandani (KTT\u2019s Executive Director). The mission of KTT is to help bring coding education to young people while empowering them to become educators who \u201cteach it forward.\u201d University students train and mentor KTT youth, and then those same youth give back to their communities by delivering KTT curriculum to other underserved young people. Read more about KTT through this interview and article . Other Outreach Journey Through The World of Analytics Join Us for a two-day professional development workshop in analytics designed for community college educators. Discover how to harness the power of data to produce smart solutions to challenges in every industry, from supply chains to finance, from e-commerce to transportation. Teach your students how to use analytics to build new products and services in the 21st century. Use analytics & operations research to enrich curriculum, unlock career opportunities, and empower students. The workshop is organized by UC Berkeley IEOR Department, in partnership with the NSF AI Institute for Advances in Optimization. T-PREP: Transfer Pre-Engineering Program Berkeley Engineering\u2019s Transfer Pre-Engineering Program (T-PREP) begins with a three week summer program offered to incoming Berkeley Engineering transfer students. T-PREP continues throughout the year with workshops and events that are for your cohort. The transition from a community college to a major research university can be challenging, and transfer students often underestimate the degree of change. Students who participate in T-PREP will be fully prepared to meet the rigors of being a junior in the College of Engineering. T-PREP is just one of the many support services offered by Engineering Student Services. \u201cBeing part of T-Prep as a student and then again as a DA and RA was one of the most impactful and fulfilling experiences during my time at Berkeley Engineering. It is a fast-paced, high-pressure program that gives incoming students a preview of what it truly means to be a Berkeley Engineer. More importantly, however, this program uplifts underrepresented student populations that are entering the College of Engineering by equipping them with not only a set of tools that will allow them to succeed but also a community that will nurture, guide, and support them through the process. T-Prep, in its entirety, is more than a program it is a family.\u201d \u2014 Abhigyan Biswas (BS IEOR '23) IISE Alumni Mentorship Initiative The IISE Alumni Mentorship Initiative aims to connect IEOR students with alumni leaders from the Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research. Alumni mentors and role models help provide mentees with guidance in academic studies, career choices, independent preparation, and general advice. Consistency is key to the success of mentorship relationships, and we ask that mentors and mentees maintain an ongoing commitment to meet at least once a month. Interested in getting matched with an alumni mentor? Complete our interest form, found here . Berkeley Mentorship Cohort The Berkeley Mentorship Cohort (BMC) is a year-long program. Getting admitted to Berkeley Engineering is a big achievement in itself. Succeeding here will challenge you in ways you might never have expected. That\u2019s why we offer a robust mentorship program to give each one of you the individual support you need. In BMC we\u2019re increasing access and equity for everyone in our community. We close opportunity gaps for marginalized groups. Providing a welcoming culture where all Berkeley Engineering students feel valued and supported by peer mentors, faculty and staff, our goal is to ensure that our students feel prepared to fully unlock their individual and collective potential by continuing to pay it forward. We\u2019ll be serving scholars at every stage of their academic careers, creating a pipeline of support and enhancing our students\u2019 holistic wellness.",
