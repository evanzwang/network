  "main_content": "Regeneron Science Talent Search finalists take in the view from the roof of the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library Courtesy of Society for Science/Chris Ayers Photography Yesterday afternoon, on March 10, the nation\u2019s top 40 young scientists climbed to the fifth floor of the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library in Washington D.C. to showcase their independent research projects and share their STEM passions with the public. This was an opportunity for the Regeneron Science Talent Search finalists to talk about what they know best: their own research. Approximately 250 attendees convened to hear from this year\u2019s talented group, congratulating them on their impressive achievements. We took some time to engage with seven students at the exhibition to gain insights into their current experiences and discover what they are particularly enthusiastic about as they look ahead. Harshil Avlani BASIS Chandler (Chandler, Arizona) Project title: Analyzing the Effect of Mid-Circuit Measurement (MCM) on Spectator Qubits Harshil Avlani studied the arrangement of qubits (units of information) located in quantum computers, hoping to reduce significant errors. He hopes his research could one day lead to performance improvement in quantum computing systems. What will Harshil be doing once he gets home from STS? He says, \u201cI\u2019m probably moving on to something new. I\u2019ve started a new project on the intersection between quantum computing and transformers, the machine learning model. So, I\u2019ll probably be doing a lot more research into that.\u201d Alan Bu Phillips Exeter Academy (Exeter, New Hampshire) Project title: On the Maximum Number of Spanning Trees in a Planar Graph With a Fixed Number of Edges: A Linear-Algebraic Connection Alan Bu\u2019s math project sheds light on the structure of planar graphs by giving precise limits on how many spanning trees a planar graph can have. A spanning tree is the connecting point of vertices in a graph. What\u2019s his favorite part of STS? \u201cI\u2019ve met a lot of amazing people here and I\u2019ve learned a lot of things from them, and I want to grow as a person as well from this experience. I\u2019ve also met a lot of people here from tons of different places, and I\u2019m looking forward to potentially seeing them again in college, and maybe even doing research together in the future.\u201d Ella Pilacek Oviedo High School (Oviedo, Florida) Project title: Promoting Attraction of Apis mellifera to the Synthetic Scent of the Endangered Orchid Prosthechea cochleata Using Pavlovian Conditioning and Direct Feeding Paradigms for Conservation Ella researched ways to teach non-native honeybees how to pollinate an endangered native orchid species, potentially enhancing pollination rates and increasing the likelihood of species survival. What\u2019s Ella most excited to bring home? She says, \u201cThe connections that I\u2019ve made with other people from a networking perspective. If I have physics question, there\u2019s someone who just did an astrophysics project that I can talk to, who I can call and do homework with. Or even beyond that, the interactions with judges. I am excited for the feedback that I\u2019m going to get from judges, hopefully at some point I can go and talk to them to ask, \u2018Hey, what should I change?\u2019 or \u2018What do you think was a weak point?\u2019 because obviously they can\u2019t tell us during judging, but it would be helpful to get this feedback later.\u201d Rhea Rastogi Loveless Academic Magnet Program High School (Montgomery, Alabama) Project title: Understanding How the Maternal Epigenetic Reprogramming Function of LSD1 Contributes to Inherited Developmental Disease Rhea Rastogi explored histone methylation and found that errors in the histone regulation in the mother\u2019s oocytes can lead to irregular gene expression patterns in offspring that give rise to behavioral defects. Her findings could provide insight into the epigenetic pathways of human patients suffering from Kabuki-like Syndrome. What\u2019s she most excited to bring home from the competition? She says, \u201cAll the female finalists have built such a close bond. We\u2019ve only seen each other for three days now, but there\u2019s so much we relate to in terms of how we feel\u2014not just in this competition but in academics and our lives. I\u2019ll also be taking home the fact that I am now free to dream about anything I want. This experience is sort of a trampoline into my future career. Now I don\u2019t have to doubt myself constantly; I know that I can do it. I just have to believe in myself.\u201d Linus Tang Davidson Academy Online (Reno, Nevada) Project title: Extremal Bounds on Peripherality Measures Linus Tang researched centrality and peripherality measures in graph theory for his math project. Applications could include tracing disease-spread and understanding systems of chemical interactions. What\u2019s his favorite part of STS so far? \u201cRight now, I\u2019m glad to have met the 39 other finalists. They are awesome people, and having met them is truly the most valuable part of this experience. I\u2019m also happy that the Regeneron Science Talent Search has given me this opportunity to share my research with others.\u201d Nathan Wei Buchholz High School (Gainesville, Florida) Project title: Novel Elastomeric Polystyrene Via Photopolymerization and Post-Functionalization of Durable Ultra-High Molecular Weight Perfluorostyrene Copolymers Nathan developed a more sustainable way to create strong and durable plastic polymers that are also recyclable. He believes this approach should also work with biologically based raw materials, which would make the process even more sustainable. What\u2019s next for his research? \u201cI\u2019m looking at a couple ways to continue this project. One thing I\u2019m looking at is making bio-based polymers. Using biologically derived resources to build different polymers might have even better properties. And another interesting study I\u2019m trying to do is investigate the properties of polymers when they\u2019re extremely, extremely, extremely hot, and finding ways to do that.\u201d Christopher Zorn Irvington High School (Irvington, New York) Project title: The Role of MYC in RET Fusion Tumorigenesis and RET Inhibitor Resistance Christopher investigated the relationship between RET, a gene involved in cellular signals, and MYC, a set of genes that regulate cell growth and death. His findings suggest paths for further drug research targeting both RET and MYC. What is Christopher most excited about so far from STS Finals Week? \u201cI\u2019m just going to keep learning. I like constantly learning new things. I wouldn\u2019t say STS changed my trajectory, but it definitely reaffirmed it. I think it\u2019s very satisfying to get my hard work acknowledged in this way. I mean, I didn\u2019t think I would get top 300, much less top 40. To be able to come here, talk to all these other kids who I know feel very similar things to me, it really is just a great experience.\u201d This week, the 40 finalists are in Washington, D.C., competing for over $1.8 million in awards. Stay tuned for the announcement of the winners on March 12, 2024, and click here for the Virtual Public Exhibition of Projects, if you missed it in person.
