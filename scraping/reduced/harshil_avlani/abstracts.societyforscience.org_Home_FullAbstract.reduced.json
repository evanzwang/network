As such, ways to characterize their performance are of great interest. Specifically, it is important to determine what impact MCM has on nearby, unmeasured, spectator qubits. Here, I present a novel benchmarking method consisting of a variation of the Interleaved Randomized Benchmarking Technique. I then use this method to evaluate MCM-induced spectator qubit error on various qubits inside IBM\u2019s quantum computer \u201cibm_nairobi\u201d. I then examine the effect of qubit position on this error, test if IBM\u2019s widely-used quantum simulators account for this error, and analyze potential causes of this error. This project has far reaching implications as it sheds light on a never before seen type of quantum error and discovers a major deficiency in current quantum simulators.
