In Sanskrit, Aadi means \u201cbeginning.\u201d When Nashikkar first ran for student government in eighth grade, he was quite unenthusiastic about his first name, because it seemed nearly everyone had their own pronunciation for it. \u201cI never corrected anyone,\u201d Nashikkar said. \u201cIt was easier to fit in if I let people take my name and mold it to their liking. I was no longer saying even my own name correctly.\u201d When he recounted his disappointment about losing his first election, Nashikkar\u2019s mother, Kshama Belsare, stopped him and asked him what he had just called himself. Nashikkar pronounced his name wrong. His mother set him straight. \u201cHaving ignored the pronunciation of my name for so long,\u201d Nashikkar said, \u201cI had played into my own whitewashing. When I confidently embraced my name, my leadership improved. I could fight for others because I was fighting for myself.\u201d Nashikkar became treasurer in 10th grade and went on to be elected student government president two years in a row. When members of student government questioned the necessity of a mental health initiative, Nashikkar defended the measure, reminding them that there were people who were unable to stand up for themselves. Nashikkar\u2019s commitment to standing up for those without a voice became the founding principle of his organization, All in AI. Inspired by his own experience struggling to find artificial-intelligence resources designed for high schoolers, Nashikkar developed his own curriculum to teach absolute beginners how to code. \u201cThe goal is to inspire students,\u201d Nashikkar said, \u201cespecially those from underrepresented groups to consider futures in AI.\" Featured Local Savings The former student is now teaching AI at his former high school. \u201cI am continuing what my mom did for me so many years ago, and my students will continue after me,\u201d he says proudly. Nashikkar is adamant that his organization All in AI will not cease to exist while he is in college. He believes it is vital that those creating technology that diverse groups of people will be using should also themselves be diverse. \u201cIf we use peer-to-peer education to propagate AI at the high school level,\u201d Nashikkar said, \u201cwe generate a new generation of diverse AI developers and professionals. Statistics say that groups like students in underserved areas and minorities won\u2019t have their voices heard at tech companies, discouraged by various social and economic obstacles.\u201d In addition to his work with All in AI, Nashikkar has been involved in Model United Nations, Matchwits and Academic World Quest. He was a state finalist in Colorado\u2019s National History Day competition, creating a documentary about the Bangladeshi genocide. As a part of the documentary, Nashikkar interviewed a survivor of a Pakistani internment camp. \u201cWe cannot separate ourselves from our history, especially when terrible tragedies like this are so recent, and still happening today, Nashikkar said. \u201cIt makes you feel that you must take action to right injustices that you are aware of.\u201d David Benson, history department chair at the Colorado Springs School, calls Nashikkar one of the \u201cmost passionate, dedicated and brilliant scholars and young leaders I have had the pleasure of working with in my 25 years of teaching.\u201d Benson said that Nashikkar is trusted and respected by his peers and teachers and in addition to his rigorous academic schedule and All in AI work, he\u2019s also taken on the responsibility of helping ninth-graders adapt to the stresses and challenges of COVID-19.
