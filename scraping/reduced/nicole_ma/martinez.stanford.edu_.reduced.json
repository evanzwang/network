  "main_content": "What We Do The Martinez lab studies RNA regulatory mechanisms that control gene expression. We focus on mRNA processing, RNA modifications and their roles in development and disease. Our Research Publications Join The Lab We are enthusiastic about training and working with the next generation of scientists. We welcome colleagues with diverse experiences, backgrounds, and skill sets. If you are curious about RNA and want to engage in stimulating research in a supportive and inclusive environment, join us. We are currently hiring at all levels. Undergraduate students If you are a Stanford undergrad please email Nicole with your CV and a short summary of research interests. Graduate students Prospective graduate students can apply to any of the Stanford PhD programs. Please email Nicole if you are interested in a rotation. Postdoctoral fellows Candidates will have a PhD in life sciences or related fields. Please email Nicole with a cover letter describing your interest in the lab, a CV and contact information for three references.
