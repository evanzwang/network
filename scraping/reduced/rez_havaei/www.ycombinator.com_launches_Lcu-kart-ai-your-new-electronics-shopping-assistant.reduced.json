Rez Havaei General Analysis 6 months ago Embed https://generalanalysis.com # saas # trust_&_safety # artificial_intelligence TL;DR: We are an interactive search platform that simplifies your research for electronic products. From any question, we extract relevant recommendations from Reddit/YouTube and trusted content creators. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96gFQhd5AGI Our ask: We would love for you to: Try https://kart.ai : we\u2019d love to help you find your favorite electronics! Share your unique chat links with friends: make it easy for them to join the conversation! Give us a follow on Linkedin \u2013 we\u2019ll have some deals soon, and we wouldn\u2019t want you to miss out! If you want us to support a new product, or give us feedback, do not hesitate to email us at founders@kart.ai Introduction We are Gordon and Rez, two recent graduates who spent a lot of the past year moving into our new apartments. Throughout this process, we have spent countless hours researching new monitors, webcams, and vacuum cleaners (anything to keep our home office setup as tidy as possible, really!). And here\u2019s what we noticed: \u274c Problem: Finding your ideal product is hard. Information Overload: from one google search for best monitors or headphones, you have to click on ten different articles just to understand the scope. Research is not personalized. There\u2019s no filter for certain specs on Google, nor a chat function for follow-up questions and iterative suggestions. SEO Spam: Online articles are often written to boost engagement, and Amazon reviews are filled with advertisers trying to make a living. We understand how arduous this may be, and we\u2019re looking forward to making your lives easier. \u2705 Solution: kart.ai turns hours of research into minutes! Ask natural queries: Setting up your work-from-home office? Trying to find the best headphones for your post-work gym session? We\u2019ll answer all these questions and any follow-ups you may have. Aggregated reviews and listings: Like a product you see? Click on a product card, and we will list out all the pros and cons. There\u2019s more: we analyze reviews across Reddit and Amazon, then find all the best deals for you. We make sure to retrieve information from sites you trust, such as Rtings, Reddit, Wirecutter, etc. Share with your friends: Want to ask your family for advice? Buying a new mini-fridge with a roommate together? All conversations have a unique link that you can share at the click of a button. We\u2019ll showcase all our favorite ones on the blog.
