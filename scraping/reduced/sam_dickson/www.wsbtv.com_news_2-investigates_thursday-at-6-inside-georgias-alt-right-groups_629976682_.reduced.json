  "main_content": "Channel 2 Investigates Inside Georgia's alt-right groups By Mark Winne, WSB-TV October 27, 2017 at 6:15 pm EDT By Mark Winne, WSB-TV October 27, 2017 at 6:15 pm EDT ATLANTA \u2014 A march that morphed into violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, earlier this year launched the alt-right into the national conversation like never before. Alt-right groups are operating in nearly every state across the country, including here in Georgia, according to a report from the Southern Poverty Law Center. Channel 2 Investigative Reporter Mark Winne dug into the alt-right closer to home and found varying views. White Nationalist Sam Dickson, an Atlanta real estate lawyer, is a self-described white nationalist, who sat down exclusively with Winne to talk about his controversial beliefs. \u201cI\u2019m a spokesman for legitimate white interests. I am not hostile to minority groups,\u201d Dickson said. Sam Dickson, an Atlanta real estate lawyer, is a self-described white nationalist. Dickson said he rejects labels like left, right or alt-right, but acknowledges he frequently speaks to alt-right groups. \u201cWhy is it right to define people by race any more than height, weight, age?\u201d Winne asked. \u201cWell, it isn\u2019t just a matter of DNA, it\u2019s also a matter of history, of culture,\u201d Dickson said. Dickson said he believes desegregation was a mistake for blacks and whites and the U.S. should be divided into \u201cracial zones.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s unnatural for people to live among people who are radically different from them,\u201d Dickson said. \u201cMy people have a right to their own homeland.\u201d Former Georgia governor and current attorney Roy Barnes, who attended UGA Law School with Dickson, scoffed at his proposal. \u201cWe are all God\u2019s children, regardless of color or complexion, or any other difference,\u201d Barnes said. \u201cChrist was probably dark-complected.\u201d III% Security Force Militia In Henry County, Chris Hill said as a Marine, he trained officer candidates but now he trains fellow III% Security Force militia members to help in natural or man-made emergencies. Alt-right groups are operating in nearly every state across the country, including here in Georgia. He says alt-right is a term that hasn\u2019t truly been defined, but he believes it is representative of his group and his beliefs. \u201cIf alt-right is one way to describe it, just short of being racist, then I\u2019d be honored to be called alt-right,\u201d Hill said. \u201cI am not a racist.\u201d Hill admits to issues with Islam but said he's for racial equality. He referred Winne to YouTube video showing two African-Americans from sister chapters training with his folks. \u201cWe\u2019re on the path of a war and it\u2019s not based on color. It\u2019s based on decay and morals and values,\u201d Hill said. League of the South Self-described Southern Nationalist, Brad Griffin, said he believes in the core principals of the alt-right. \u201cThe alt-right believes in the identity, the heritage and the rights of white southerners and white Americans,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cI don\u2019t advocate taking away anyone\u2019s rights.\u201d LATEST INVESTIGATIONS: Controversial pet store defends allegations it sells sick dogs City officials' business class trip to South Africa cost $90K, records show Heroin epidemic costs nearly $22 billion each year Griffin is a member of the League of the South. Brad Griffin is a self-described Southern Nationalist and a member of the League of the South. \u201cIt\u2019s kinda hard to believe in equal rights and nondiscrimination when those principals don\u2019t apply to us,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cI do not believe in the system we have now, where other groups are promoted but our rights are violated and we're discriminated against. It's not just.\u201d But attorney and Black Lives Matter Atlanta organizer Tiffany Roberts says that\u2019s not true. \u201cIt\u2019s not factually accurate to say that somehow protecting the right of all Americans, regardless of their racial identity, is somehow harmful to white folks,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cThe farther away we get from slavery and Jim Crow, the more uncomfortable and upset certain people are.\u201d Attorney Chris Stewart says the alt-right is just another cause of divisiveness in our country. \u201cIt\u2019s just another vehicle for the animosity that\u2019s already grown so much between people,\u201d he said. The controversial groups exist in almost every county in Georgia.
