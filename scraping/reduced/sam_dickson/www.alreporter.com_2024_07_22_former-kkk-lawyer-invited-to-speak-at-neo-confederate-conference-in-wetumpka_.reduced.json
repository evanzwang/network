  "main_content": "STOCK Getting your Trinity Audio player ready... The Southern Cultural Center will host its third annual \u201cnational conference,\u201d this time inviting a former Ku Klux Klan lawyer to join its crop of speakers. Sam Dickson of Atlanta frequently represented the Klan in the courtroom and has since become a real estate mogul while frequently pushing his white nationalist message. He ran for lieutenant governor of Georgia in 1978 on a segregation platform and belongs to numerous extremist groups. He joins returning extremists invited to convene in Wetumpka at the Southern Cultural Center headquarters. The state goal of the SCC is for the South to secede once again and establish a new Confederacy. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, Dickson has appeared most frequently over the last 15 years speaking at the biannual conference of the white supremacist journal American Renaissance. Jared Taylor, the founder of American Renaissance, returns to the conference as a speaker this year.

Here are just a few of the principles listed by the program itself: Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading. Since family is the foundation of any strong society, we are against feminism, abortion, and primitivism. We wish to revive the White birthrate above replacement level fertility and beyond to grow the percentage of Whites in the world relative to other races. Secession is a right of all people and individuals. It was successful in 1776 and this show honors those who tried to make it successful in 1865. We are against homosexuality, vulgarity, loveless sex, and masochism. At last year\u2019s conference, Edwards told the audience that the masses are poised for revolutionary change, with the idea of secession now increasingly popular.\u201d According to a post on the SCC Facebook page, \u201cthe National Conference is the next step in the progression of restoring our own political destiny free of Federal control of our State and local government. \u201cMore importantly, it is the restoring of the control of the raising and education of our children and the biblical Christian foundation of the Southern people.\u201d The SCC began hosting the conference in 2022 and boasted that last year\u2019s conference led to six new memberships.
