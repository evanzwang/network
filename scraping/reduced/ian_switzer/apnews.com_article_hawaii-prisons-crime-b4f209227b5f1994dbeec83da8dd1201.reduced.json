In an interview with The Associated Press from the Big Island, he reflected on a range of emotions, from his faith in God that kept him positive to his complicated feelings about police and the criminal justice system to a quest to help solve who really killed Dana Ireland. \u201cWe want justice for Dana,\u201d Schweitzer said. Schweitzer said he considers himself a victim of the same crimes he was convicted of: \u201cI feel like they murdered 25 years of my life. I feel like they kidnapped me away from my family. I feel like they raped me of being a son.\u201d A judge ordered his release Tuesday after hours of expert testimony on new evidence showing Schweitzer wasn\u2019t responsible for the death of Ireland, 23, a tourist from Virginia. She was visiting a remote part of the Big Island when she was found along a fishing trail, raped and beaten and barely alive. She died later at a hospital. RELATED COVERAGE Alabama governor commutes death row inmate Rocky Myers\u2019 sentence to life in prison Trump\u2019s top prosecutor in DC demotes several supervisors who handled politically sensitive cases A West Virginia judge orders monitor for foster kids in hotels as another dismisses a federal suit The new evidence, thanks to advances in DNA testing, included a finding that a T-shirt discovered nearby and soaked with Ireland\u2019s blood belonged to an unknown man, and not Schweitzer or the two others convicted of killing her. Hawaii County Prosecuting Attorney Kelden Waltjen said in a statement this week that his office is committed to identifying that unknown man. He was expected to make an announcement about the case Thursday. Repeated attempts by The Associated Press to reach Ireland\u2019s relatives were unsuccessful. \u201cI think there\u2019s a sister out there, you know, God bless her,\u201d Schweitzer said. \u201cI want her to know that my team is going to do everything that they possibly can to work with ... prosecutors in finding the unknown DNA.\u201d Innocence Project attorneys in Hawaii and New York filed a petition late Monday outlining the new evidence and seeking Schweitzer\u2019s release. They are also studying a Hawaii statute that would let him collect $50,000 for every year he was behind bars. Barry Scheck, one of his New York attorneys, said they don\u2019t expect prosecutors to pursue further charges and he hopes Hawaii can learn from this case. \u201cIf three innocent people could be convicted in the biggest murder case in the history of the state, then people have to step back and say, how can we prevent this from happening again?\u201d Scheck said. Attorneys are now turning to exonerating the other two. They include Schweitzer\u2019s younger brother Shawn, who took a guilty plea deal after his brother was convicted in 2000 and sentenced to 130 years. The younger Schweitzer recanted in October, which helped bolster the case for his brother\u2019s release. Keith Shigetomi, the lawyer who represented Shawn Schweitzer when he pleaded guilty in exchange for credit for about year in jail, said Wednesday that he truly believed back then that he could convince a jury of his client\u2019s innocence, but Shawn Schweitzer feared telling the truth would mean sharing the same fate as his brother. The family thought about it. \u201cIan told him, do it, save yourself,\u201d Shigetomi said, adding that lawyers are working on withdrawing the plea. The Schweitzers became suspects amid intense pressure to find Ireland\u2019s killer. In 1994, Frank Pauline Jr. came forward and claimed he was with them when Ian Schweitzer ran Ireland\u2019s bike over and then killed her. But he was interviewed at least seven times and gave inconsistent accounts each time. When it was clear he would be indicted along with the Schweitzers, he tried to take it all back and said he had lied to try to get drug charges dropped against his half-brother. Pauline was convicted, along with the brothers, and killed by a fellow inmate in a New Mexico prison in 2015. Myles Breiner, an attorney representing Pauline\u2019s family, said Wednesday he will file a motion seeking to have him posthumously exonerated. Ian Schweitzer said it\u2019s clear to him the justice system is flawed. \u201cIt didn\u2019t matter if I was innocent,\u201d he said. \u201cThey just needed a conviction.\u201d Martin Tankleff knows how Schweitzer feels. He was wrongly convicted of murdering his parents on Long Island, New York, and was released in 2007 after 17 years in prison. \u201cThe best piece of advice I can give him is take it extremely slow,\u201d Tankleff said, recalling how he was overwhelmed by everyday things like the options in the cereal aisle of the grocery store. \u201cThe world will be completely different.\u201d Schweitzer served his time in Arizona because of a lack of prison space in Hawaii. Back on the Big Island, he reflected on what it felt like to be home. \u201cSitting right here in this beautiful hotel, it looks the same,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I know once I go down the street and everything\u2019s changed, everything\u2019s changed.\u201d ___ AP journalist Claire Rush in Portland and researcher Jennifer Farrar in New York contributed to this report.",
