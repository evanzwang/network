(Marco Garcia/The Innocence Project via AP Images, File) Read More By JENNIFER SINCO KELLEHER Share Share Copy Link copied Email Facebook X Reddit LinkedIn Pinterest Flipboard Print HONOLULU (AP) \u2014 Two Native Hawaiian brothers who were convicted in the 1991 killing of a woman visiting Hawaii allege in a federal lawsuit that local police framed them \u201cunder immense pressure to solve the high-profile murder\u201d then botched an investigation last year that would have revealed the real killer using advancements in DNA technology. Albert \u201cIan\u201d Schweitzer, who had been incarcerated for more than two decades for the killing of Dana Ireland, was released in 2023 based on new evidence. Ireland, 23, a tourist from Virginia, was visiting a remote part of the Big Island when she was found along a fishing trail, raped and beaten and barely alive. She died at a hospital. Schweitzer was one of three men who spent time behind bars over her killing, but he always maintained his innocence. His brother Shawn Schweitzer took a deal to plead guilty to manslaughter and kidnapping \u2014 and receive credit for about a year served and five years of probation \u2014 after a jury convicted his brother in 2000. The brothers\u2019 lawsuit insists they \u201chad nothing to do with the crime\u201d and that investigators never found physical evidence linking them to Ireland\u2019s murder. The suit was filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Honolulu. It names as defendants Hawaii County, the county police chief, as well as former detectives and a prosecutor who handled the case. Both the county and the police chief say they won\u2019t comment on pending litigation. The lawsuit alleges the misconduct continued into last year, when advancements in DNA technology led to the identification of a new possible suspect who killed himself after police took a DNA swab from him. Police took no steps to arrest 57-year-old Albert Lauro Jr., who lived less than 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) from where Ireland\u2019s body was found, even when they knew DNA connected him to the crime scene evidence, lawyers for the Schweitzers said. \u201cInstead, Defendants released Mr. Lauro, allowing a man who had been hiding a secret for more than two decades to return home free to do whatever he wanted to do,\u201d the lawsuit said. The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for claims including denying the brothers their constitutional right to due process, conspiracy and malicious prosecution. William Harrison, one of the Honolulu attorneys for the brothers, said Wednesday a separate effort is ongoing to seek compensation from the state for their wrongful convictions. Ian Schweitzer is entitled to $50,000 for every year spent in prison as a result of his wrongful conviction, Harrison said, noting Shawn Schweitzer spent a year in jail. ___ This story has been updated to restore a dropped letter in the first name of the woman killed, she is Dana Ireland, not Dan Ireland.",
