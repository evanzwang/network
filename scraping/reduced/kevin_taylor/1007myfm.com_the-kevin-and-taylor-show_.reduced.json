On the \u201cKevin & Taylor Show,\u201d we try to share the \u201cwelcoming heart of God\u201d while having \u201cGood, Clean, Fun.\u201d The Kevin and Taylor Show is a safe place to hang out, a judgment-free zone where we can do life together, laugh at ourselves, and lighten the load of everyday life. The Kevin & Taylor show is one of the longest-running morning shows ever. Sometimes we must pinch ourselves, we\u2019re so grateful we get to do this for a living in the city we love, When we\u2019re not on the air, you\u2019ll spot us both hanging out with our families, Kevin on the green belt riding his road bike, or Taylor falling off her mountain bike in the foothills. We can\u2019t thank you enough for being part of this show. We love when you call, when you come to events, and catching up with us on social media after the show.
