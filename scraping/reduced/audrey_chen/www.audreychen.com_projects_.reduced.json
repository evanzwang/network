Their improvisations are fearless, fragile, hungry, passionate, riotous, ululating and animalistic, yet are also in all respects, human. They express, pronounce and intensely articulate (in their fashion) the many nuanced shades of their individual and collaborative conditions. \".......For those two voices interpenetrate to produce a more complex song. It\u2019s a single voice branching out. Here, what the voice produces is actually what singing has not explored, what has been left behind as something impure or non-complying. Something similar can be brightly heard in Scelsi\u2019s vocal pieces. There is also a similarity with the complex vocal works (the logatomes) L\u00e9o Kupper extensively produced in the mid-\u201860s. At times, the music seems to lead us to a meaning that is deeper than the textual level. Or is it the depth of another possible song? That\u2019s when the music takes us to areas that seem closer to the sacred, left untouched by mediation, even slightly incomprehensible, though mostly ambivalent and reality-piercing. Both voices in interaction, perpetually urging the other on, producing more than their simple addition, producing a third voice \u2013 like a semi-autonomous organism \u2013 very difficult to explain how \u2013 why \u2013 as if what had been mostly deeply burrowed was surfacing. An UR-song, like Schwitters\u2019 UR-sonate. Something basal \u2013 though from an uncharted base. Music that should be listened to before one even perceives the slightest melody. An infra-song that encompasses everything including the comical, the grotesque, the exacerbation of a mood, and the extreme pain that obscurely lives inside all of us. Everything comes up effortlessly.....\" ---- Guy -Marc Hinant (Subrosa Editions) Chen and Minton have been performing as a duo for more than a decade with concerts/tours in Europe, the US, China, Argentina and Brazil. Their duo album, By the Stream , was released by SUBROSA in 2013. https://www.subrosa.net/en/catalogue/soundworks/phil-minton--audrey-chen.html http://www.popmatters.com/review/171884-phil-minton-audrey-chen-by-the-stream/ BEAM SPLITTER - AUDREY CHEN / Henrik Munkeby N\u00f8rsteb\u00f8 (voice, electronics, trombone) ... as with many seemingly incongruous pairings, what defines the subtle union of this duo are the deeper synergies that are simmering beneath the surface. BEAM SPLITTER are: Henrik Munkeby N\u00f8rsteb\u00f8 (NO) and Audrey Chen (US). Using the trombone and voice, they maneuver a balance between fragility, intimacy, the ecstatic and measured control. They share a common sense of pulse and an inherent understanding of the way they each aurally manage and let go of every consecutive moment. The lungs release through to mouths to bell, back and forth like a tactile breathing exchange. Since beginning their collaboration in 2015, N\u00f8rsteb\u00f8 and Chen have been extensively touring the globe, in Europe, New Zealand, Argentina, Brazil, and the USA. They have taken part in larger commissioned works at the Teatro Colon, Buenos Aires and largely conceptualized a theatrical adaptation of MEDEA in front of the Olympic Stadium in Kiev, Ukraine (for butoh dancers and musicians) produced by the Ukho Agency. They have shared their collaborative projects with artists such as Phil Minton, Bob Ostertag, Michael Vorfeld, Thomas Rohrer, Valentin Tszin, Flavia Ghisalberti and Leonel Kaplan. Beam Splitter will release their debut album in 2017. \" Beam Splitter is highly improvised, extremely crafted and held in an iron will for experimentation.\" - Jean Louis Fernandez, La Nacion , Buenos Aires, Argentina, 2016. www.beamsplitter.org VOICE/PROCESS - AUDREY CHEN / HUGO ESQUINCA (voice, digital process) VOICE / PROCESS simultaneously explores the dynamics between a sonorous body, the processing interaction of a system that responds directly to the particularities of its spectra and the relation these two have with a defined space. In this sense, human- machine relations enter into a mediation through a double articulation. This double articulation emerges from the inherent temporalities of vocality and the processual speeds of computational devices which carry within them the capacity to extend the intervening at the same time as they react to the spatial characteristics of a defined architecture. https://www.dekj.org/ MOPCUT - LUKAS KOENIG / AUDREY CHEN / JULIEN DESPREZ (drums, electronics, voice, guitar) With Lukas K\u00f6nig on synthesizers and drums, Julien Desprez on electric guitar and vocalist Audrey Chen. Three artists have joined forces to create songs beyond language and gravity at the interface of sound architecture and performance-ritual. Minimal and maximal improvisation, noise and electronics overlayed by Audrey Chen\u00b4s ecstatic vocals. http://www.trost.at/artist-mopcut.html AUDREY CHEN / KAFFE MATTHEWS (voice, live electronics) All new file exchange mind-melter from 2nd generation Chinese/Taiwanese-American musician Audrey Chen & British electroacoustic artist Kaffe Matthews: \"Breathing air as dark swallows was made during the three month COVID-19 lockdown period in Berlin 2020. Kaffe and I decided to embark on a music exchange after participating in a chain recording project isolated.connected initiated by Sabine Vogel. The first track of this album is the result of that, our first sonic meeting, inspired by prior recordings by Sabine and Michael Thieke. We then decided to continue the process by taking it in turns to send each other improvised solos to which the other would respond, producing four highly tactile and intimate breathing movements. Kaffe plays digital oscillators through a glu-box, whilst processing through resampling and granulation. Spatialization is via the pink ball Java interface and Touch OSC. I use my voice.\" - Audrey Chen https://thesampler.org/news-opinion/takuroku-breathing-air-as-dark-swallows/ https://www.kaffematthews.net/ HISS & VISCERA - AUDREY CHEN / RICHARD SCOTT (voice, modular synthesizers) \u201cHiss and Viscera\u201d is Sound Anatomy\u2019s fourth album release and presents a striking debut recording from two highly distinctive voices in the richly varied Berlin improvising scene. On the face of it the human voice and analogue synthesizer may appear to have little in common but Audrey Chen and Richard Scott share an intuitive, corporeal and dynamic sound world out of which an intense and sustained musical conversation develops. Phrases and interjections bounce and ricochet between Chen\u2019s vivid lexicon of glottal pops, rasps and expulsions and Scott\u2019s exhaustive catalogue of electronic clangs, plosives and propulsions. The resultant musical conversation may not always seem entirely human in origin, conjuring sonic images of stories, languages and environments populated by many unearthly creatures, real or imagined. https://soundanatomy.bandcamp.com/album/hiss-and-viscera AFTERBURNER - AUDREY CHEN / Doron Sadja (voice, electronics, light) Berlin based AFTERBURNER is a collaborative project of vocalist Audrey Chen and electronic artist Doron Sadja. Unique in a crowded field of voice and electronics duos, the pair weaves together Chen\u2019s idiosyncratic vocal growls and chirps with Sadja\u2019s dense synthetic atmospheres into a singular monolithic texture. Intimate, dark, chaotic and ritualistic, AFTERBURNER have created a fascinating vision of romantic noise music that is all their own. http://afterburnernoise.tumblr.com/ SEN RYO NO - AUDREY CHEN / TARA TRANSITORY / BALY NGUYEN (voice, cello, modular synthesizers) Their work crosses the disciplines of experimental music and performance. Audrey Chen has created an uncompromising and idiosyncratic music, tightly disciplined yet acoustically wild and heavy with implication. Her ultra-verbal vocalising, exposes physiological aspects of utterance that are concealed within standardised articulation and day to day speech. Nguy\u1ec5n Baly encompasses experimental music and performance from an urgent postcolonial perspective exploring themes related to gender, ethnicity and the diasporic condition in her practice. Tara Transitory has relentlessly sought the interstices as an artist whose practice amalgamates sound, performance, video and installation. For years, she looked into the effects of sound on our sensitivities, the state of trance and the collective experience, traditional rituals in Southeast Asia, the effects of matriarchal, postcolonial and ancestral histories on a contemporary artistic practice. https://nguyentransitory.wordpress.com/ JOHN BOCK'S Lecker Puste (Delicious Breath) Performance March 10, 2012 The Watermill Center 39 Watermill Towd Road Water Mill, New York In 2009, the M\u00e9tamatic Research Initiative decided to host an open call for entries, in its quest to promote artistic research to the legacy of the artist Jean Tinguely. The result was an overwhelming response of 297 valid entries of which an internationally renowned jury selected eight artists. Berlin based Artist John Bock was amongst the eight selected artists with his proposal for a concert for voice, cello, land machine and objects, which he further developed during the course of 2011. Jury report by Roland Wetzel, director of the Museum Tinguely, Basel: \u2018John Bocks proposal addresses central issues of Tinguelys m\u00e9tamatics. It opens up a complex scenario through the setting of machine and man interaction with weird mechanisms of transmission to produce a surreal scenario of pathetic and intimate gestures in the \u201cconcert\u201d he intends to produce. Sculptural power, multiple kinetical issues, references to art history (as for example an intimate theatre of \u201cla mari\u00e9e mise a nue\u2026\u201d) and acoustical paraphrases will result in a showdown of exuberant beauty and disturbia (we hope\u2026). The strength of Bocks approach to M\u00e9ta-Matic lies as well in its literal understanding and in its creative, perpetual and spectacular transformation.\u2019 Cast Cellist: Audrey Chen Dancer: Colin Stilwell Foley Artist: Leslie Bloome About John Bock John Bock\u2019s work has been included in several collections such as MoMA, New York, MoCA, Los Angeles, Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, TATE, London and Museum f\u00fcr Moderne Kunst, Frankfurt.
