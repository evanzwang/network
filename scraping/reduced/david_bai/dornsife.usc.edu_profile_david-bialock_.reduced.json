Research Specialties Premodern Japanese literature, classical Japanese poetry, literature and the environment, ecocriticism. Detailed Statement of Research Interests The early focus of my research was classical Japanese literature, especially waka poetics and medieval literature related to The Tale of the Heike and its variants. More recent research has focused on music in medieval Japanese literature, mythology, and literature and the environment. In my research and teaching, I try to bring Japanese literature into dialogue with other literatures and disciplinary perspectives. Publications Book Bialock, D. T.
