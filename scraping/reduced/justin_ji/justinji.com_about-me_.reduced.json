  "main_content": "Academic Interests I\u2019m passionate about AI interpretability research\u2014understanding how AI models work internally to make them safer and more trustworthy for society. During my junior year, I collaborated with the Harvard Kempner Institute on a project investigating how language models adopt \u201cpersonas\u201d and designing interventions to influence them. In high school, I did competitive programming and math (USACO Platinum, AIME). I\u2019ve also competed in hackathons and enjoy building side projects that are both technically interesting and impactful. Check out some of my work in the projects tab. I also enjoy learning about other fields in AI, data visualization, algorithmic game theory, literature, and writing.
