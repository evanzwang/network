I have been in this position for 1 year, but prior to that I was the Vice-President for 6 years. I also served as the secretary shortly after my graduation. I currently work as the Educational Interpreting Consultant for Manitoba Education but I also do other contract interpreting, primarily in the religious setting. I have been married for 14 years and we have four kids who keep me very busy! I am looking forward to being a part of this new board for the next couple of years. I think we have board members with a variety of different backgrounds and skills. I am excited to see how this board can better improve MAVLI. \u200b [email protected] Erica Trethart / V ice President / 2022-2025 I graduated from the 4-year ASL-English Interpretation Program (University of Manitoba/Red River College) in 2010. I have worked primarily as a staff interpreter for the Manitoba School for the Deaf and Manitoba Education but have also done some freelance and post-secondary work. I am originally from Thompson, MB, but moved to Winnipeg to get my Music Degree in Percussion. I am married and have two young sons and a dog. I love travelling, music and baking. I am enjoying my current role as Vice President of MAVLI, but have also been Treasurer, Secretary and MEC Chair. MAVLI is here to support interpreters, so please be in touch with any questions or concerns. \u200b [email protected] Monica Furer / Treasurer / 2017 - 2025 I am currently in my fourth term and final year as Treasurer of MAVLI and have enjoyed working on the board. I graduated from the combined RRC/UofM AEIP in 2005. I work primarily in the post-secondary setting, but also do some free-lance and pro-bono interpretation in the general community. \u200b \u200b [email protected] Miranda Murphy / Secretary / 2022-2025 Hello everyone! I graduated in 2021 from the final four-year AEIP joint program between RRC and U of M. It has been a pleasure working in K-12, faith based, and in the community. I love being able to connect with the Deaf and Interpreting community at different events hosted throughout the year! \u200b I am enjoying my new role as Secretary of MAVLI. Previously, I have been on the board as Public Relations as well as AEIP student representative. Outside of work, I enjoy spending time at the lake, and travelling to new destinations. I look forward to seeing you around! \u200b [email protected] Shaina Dumont / Membership / 2024-2025 This will be my 4th term on the MAVLI board in the Membership position. After graduating in 2011 I worked as a contractor for ECCOE for one year where I was then hired as a staff interpreter and have been ever since. I enjoy being on the board where I can learn from colleagues and provide insight where I can. When I\u2019m not running my kids around to activities, I spend a lot of my free time with them and my husband on our farm raising cattle. \u200b\u200b [email protected] Vacant / Fundraising This position is currently vacant.

I enjoy spending time in the garden, crafting, and visiting with friends and family. I look forward to connecting with you all soon. \u200b [email protected] Meg Toews / Professional Development / 2023 - 2024 Hi there, I graduated in 2022 from the ASL- English Interpretation Program and have enjoyed being involved in faith-based, performing arts, community and VRS interpreting. I have been married for 6 years and enjoy traveling with my partner to find new places in Manitoba to go kayaking. Outside of work I love to be at home knitting, playing ukulele, or reading a good book with a London Fog in hand. I am thrilled to be on the board with my incredible friends and colleagues, Sheryl and Dawn-Marie, as we get to think of new topics to discuss with the amazing interpreters in our community. I love being able to share strategies, ask questions, and learn from each other in such a safe and inviting space. I am looking forward to another great year on the board! \u200b [email protected] Joa Brunstein / Public Relations / 2024-2025 Hello! I graduated from the ASL English Interpretation at Red River College Polytechnic in 2023, and I\u2019ve recently been working as an Interpreter. Since graduation I have been mostly working in the community as well as some faith-based work. This is my first time on the MAVLI Board and I am very excited to be a part of this incredible organization and working alongside talented and amazing interpreters! I am quite the reader and enjoy spending my time outside walking or rollerblading, you will not catch me out in the winter! Hopefully I will see you around! [email protected] Jenn Horvath / Member at Large / 2022-2025 I graduated in 2003 from the first four year AEIP at Red River College/University of Manitoba. I have always enjoyed my time on the MAVLI board as a few different positions over the years. I primarily work in post secondary and freelance in the community. I have been married for 15 years and have two daughters, ages 8 and 12 who keep us very busy! It\u2019s been almost 20 years, and I still love interpreting thanks to our amazing colleagues and Deaf community.

I also work part time doing VRS work. I am excited to be on the board with my co-chair Shannon. Looking forward to the MAVLI MTS PD day this year! I recently got married in the summer of 2023. My husband and I enjoy traveling. I also love to crochet and spend as much time outside as possibly enjoying warm weather. Thanks, Kristen \u200b Shannon Graham / MAVLI Education Committee / 2023-2025 \u200bHi there! I have been an interpreter for three years now, and have been absolutely loving it! I graduated from the joint four year ASL-English Interpreting Program with the University of Manitoba. I have worked in post-secondary, community, K-12, performing arts, freelance, and VRS. I enjoy working at different places because I love the challenge and the opportunity to learn something new. I love music, nail art and cooking when I\u2019m not interpreting. This is my first year on the MAVLI board, I\u2019m really excited to be a part of it and to be more involved. \u200b Amar Schiwietz / Digital Media Coordinator / 2023-2025 Hey there! I'm a recent graduate of the first \"new-new\" 3 year AEIP program at RRC. The majority of my work is in the virtual relay interpreting setting. I'm extremely thankful to able to do work on this, the MAVLI Board of Directors. In my free time I enjoy thru-hiking trails, playing video games, and playing guitar in various bands/musical productions across the city. During my time on this board, I hope to help maintain and improve the technological side of MAVLI, with its website and social media presence. Coming from a background of computer technology and building computers from an early age, I hope I can be of good service to this board and its members. Cheers! \u200b [email protected] Powered by Create your own unique website with customizable templates.
