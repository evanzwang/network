  "main_content": "Going green: Blazing a trail in sustainability PUBLISHED 16 September 2021 WRITTEN BY Barbara Zuroick, US Fleet and Safety Manager for AstraZeneca As a global biopharmaceutical company we have a responsibility to be industry leaders in positively impacting society and protecting the environment. In January 2020, AstraZeneca announced its \u2018 Ambition Zero Carbon \u2019 plan to achieve zero carbon emissions from our operations by 2025 and to ensure our entire value chain is carbon negative by 2030, bringing forward decarbonization plans by more than a decade. We committed to invest $1 billion over the next ten years to deliver targets that are among the boldest in the industry. Part of this ambitious strategy includes moving toward an entirely global fleet, operating on solely electric vehicles by 2025. This effort forms a key part of our overall sustainability strategy and moves us closer to our goal of sourcing 100% of our global electricity consumption from renewable sources by 2025 and reducing our carbon footprint. We\u2019re proud to have made significant progress toward our ambition over the past year, ranking#7 in the 2021 Top 50 Green Fleets (up from #16 in 2019)and #1 in the pharmaceutical industry. AstraZeneca operates a US fleet of approximately 5,000 SUVs and cars, including several light trucks. By the end of 2021 about 3,900 of these vehicles will be hybrid-electric vehicles. Additionally, we are introducing battery-electric vehicles (BEV) into our commercial fleet vehicle portfolio. I can proudly say that AstraZeneca is leading the way in the path toward environmentally friendly vehicles in the US, which is beneficial not only for our environment, but society at large. There is a challenging learning curve associated with being among the few pharmaceutical companies prioritizing green vehicles. By creating and leveraging a strong industry network, we have been able to gather key learnings from other fleets in the industry and then implement an agile and strategy approach to achieve this green transition. I am extremely proud of the work Barbara Zuroick and the team has done to advance our green fleet within AstraZeneca. This initiative affirms our long-term commitment to sustainability by reducing the carbon footprint with our fleet vehicle selection. Our continued advances in this space asserts our commitment to society, and helps us become a leader in sustainable business in the community\u2014 socially, economically and environmentally. Barbara Zuroick, US Fleet and Safety Manager for AstraZeneca, with the demo electric vehicle car selection.",
