Prior to my current position, I was a postdoctoral fellow at Clemson University, where I had the privilege of collaborating closely with Professor Timo Heister in the development of open-source finite element libraries. I received my PhD in mathematics from Virginia Tech in 2020 under the guidance of Professor Pengtao Yue . My research focuses on designing numerical algorithms to solve mathematical models derived from complex physical processes, developing efficient parallel solvers, and analyzing numerical results to explore underlying physics. The physical problems I am working on include dynamic wetting on (soft) solids, interfacial flows of a poroelastic hydrogel, brain concussion based on the hydrogel model, as well as three-phase (gas, liquid, solid) solidification with moving contact lines. Research Finite-element simulations of interfacial flows with moving contact lines.
