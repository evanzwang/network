After a steep drop in hiring at the beginning of the pandemic, openings surged last year. Now Stanford Career Education (BEAM) is seeing both job opportunities and applicants approach or surpass their pre-pandemic numbers. And in a just-released report , the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) projects that employers plan to hire almost 33 percent more new college graduates in 2022 than in 2021. There are some changes and challenges, however. For example, it appears that virtual and hybrid opportunities are here to stay. This allows students to apply for a wider variety of positions \u2013 though it also increases the competition. It can also help students who find part-time opportunities, since it\u2019s easier to juggle two part-time positions if they are virtual. Some larger companies \u2014 the big consulting firms, for example \u2013 have already selected their summer interns and new hires who will start in the summer. This chart of recruiting timelines shows when companies in different industries typically do their hiring (though some industries, such as consulting and finance, are moving to recruit even earlier). That doesn\u2019t mean there are no opportunities left in April. \u201cThere are positions available all year round, regardless of industry,\u201d said John (J.B.) Horsley \u201919, employer engagement coordinator at BEAM. Networking: the most common path to a job For those still looking, networking is a crucial tool. On average, 70 percent of opportunities come from networking, compared with 30 percent from job postings, Horsley said. \u201cNetworking is your best friend,\u201d Horsley said. Still, \u201cit\u2019s a terrifying word to many students. They don\u2019t want to make a bad impression or take advantage of someone.\u201d Because the most effective networking benefits both parties, students with little work experience may feel like they have nothing to offer. But Horsley said alums and others who talk to students simply enjoy the conversations. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s just about talking about something you both enjoy,\u201d Horsley said. Divya Mehrish, Class of \u201925, has used networking \u2014 including with a Stanford alum \u2014 to identify several media and law-based opportunities for the summer. \u201cI\u2019m looking at how I could combine various experiences,\u201d she said, which may be possible since not all of them are full-time for the whole summer. Vedant Khanna, Class of \u201925, found his summer internship, with the Santa Clara office of Tata Digital, through a virtual career fair that he heard about from his introductory computer science class. Khanna didn\u2019t start his search until winter quarter, and he was successful. But he realized that he had missed the recruiting cycle for some tech companies by starting that late. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for an internship for the summer, it\u2019s best to start as early as possible,\u201d Khanna said. Tailored applications vs. mass production Creating a good resume is worth the time. \u201cOn average, a recruiter spends 7 to 30 seconds on the first read of a resume, leaning much closer to 7,\u201d Horsley said. \u201cYou want to make sure that your resume is explicitly showing the skills they\u2019re looking for.\u201d Is it best to customize a resume and cover letter for each position, or is it better to send out as many resumes as possible even if they\u2019re all the same? It\u2019s possible to find a job using either approach, Horsley said. A carefully tailored resume \u2014 one that matches the job-seeker\u2019s experience and skills with the job description \u2014 is the most likely to be noticed. However, early-career job seekers will likely need to apply for many opportunities, and it may not be practical to create custom resumes for each. Horsley suggests that students use a hybrid approach, creating a version of their resume for each industry or type of position they are considering. Other tips Horsley offers several other tips for students still looking for a summer opportunity: Contact employers who have already completed their internship recruitments for summer 2022 and ask if they have any available internships. They may have several rescinded offers and may welcome the chance to consider your application. If you opt for this approach, be sure to have your resume ready to share and be willing to interview immediately, as employers may be looking to fill vacancies very quickly. Search for more than internships. In Handshake, some employers don\u2019t take the time to specify the category for each position, so some internships end up posted as a \u201cfull-time\u201d or \u201cpart-time job.\u201d Students can also search for \u201cinternship\u201d in the search bar. Consider other options for the summer. Students who are unable to secure a job or internship for the whole summer should look for other ways to build their resumes. Gig or project work is one way to do this \u2014 and the Stanford Alumni Mentoring platform is one place to start looking. Taking a class \u2014 to learn a new programming language, for example \u2014 may also be a good way to fill resume gaps. Stanford offers access to LinkedIn Learning . Don\u2019t be discouraged by experience requirements. Many employers are asking for a year or more of experience for positions they describe as entry-level. In reality, they often don\u2019t actually care about the years of experience and just want to know that a job seeker has the skills to solve their problem. Additionally, Horsley said that those years of experience can be demonstrated through various types of experiences beyond just jobs and internships. Focus on transferable skills. Transferable skills are what most employers view as the most important. Horsley said classwork, volunteer positions, independent projects, and service jobs such as retail or restaurant work can all contribute skills for a resume. \u201cHow do we turn the experience we have into what an employer is looking for?\u201d Horsley said. \u201cTeamwork, communication, customer service, hard work, time management: There\u2019s a large number of transferable skills that you are bringing to the table.\u201d Subscribe to Stanford Report News, insights and events delivered to your inbox each weekday morning.
