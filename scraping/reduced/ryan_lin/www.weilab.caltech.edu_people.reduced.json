Too fascinated by the stimulated Raman scattering microscopy, she decided to stay at Columbia, continuing her postdoctoral work on developing new nonlinear vibrational imaging techniques. Lu joined the faculty at Caltech in 2018. Lu has recently been recognized by the 2017 ACS PHYS Division Young Investigator Award, the 2018 Blavatnik Regional Awards for Young Scientists, the 2019 Amgen Early Innovator Award, the 2020 NIH Director's New Innovator Award, the 2022 Sloan Research Fellowship, the 2022 Emerging Leader in Molecular Spectroscopy Award, the 2022 Vallee Scholar Award, the 2023 NSF CAREER Award, and the 2024 BPS Margaret Oakley Dayhoff Award. Lu is also a Heritage Medical Research Institute (HMRI) investigator and a Ronald and JoAnn Willens Scholar at Caltech. Haomin Wang Postdoc, Ph.D., haominw@caltech.edu Haomin graduated as a Ph.D. from Lehigh University. During his Ph.D., he was advised by Prof. Xiaoji Xu on developing novel s-SNOM and AFM-IR methods to reveal details in the nanoworld. Haomin joined the Wei lab in 2020 and is specifically interested in utilizing light-matter interactions as tools to resolve complex systems at fundamental levels. In his free time, Haomin enjoys Karaoke, hiking, and video games. His GOAT game so far is The Legend of Zelda: BotW. Jiajun Du Postdoc, Ph.D., jddu@caltech.edu Jiajun graduated with B.S. from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2017, majoring in Chemistry. At USTC, he worked with Prof. Guoqing Zhang on luminescent soft materials. Ryan Leighton Postdoc, Ph.D., leigh164@caltech.edu Ryan earned his Ph.D. from the University of Minnesota in 2023. His Ph.D. research focused on developing new methods for achieving super-resolution label-free imaging using stimulated Raman spectroscopy. His research interests center around developing new nonlinear optical methods to study biological systems, with an emphasis on cellular membranes and ion channels. His hobbies include crocheting and video games. His current favorite game is Baldur\u2019s Gate 3. Dongkwan (Kwan) Lee Graduate Student, ChemE, dongkwan@caltech.edu Kwan was raised in Seoul, South Korea. He earned his B.S. in Chemical Engineering and a minor in Electrical Engineering from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he worked in the labs of Prof. Bhargava and Prof. Bailey. When not in lab, Kwan enjoys getting outside, playing basketball, and hoping the LA Lakers will make the Western Conference Finals. Xiaotian Bi Graduate Student, Chem, xbi@caltech.edu Xiaotian was born and raised in Shandong Province, China. She received her B.S. degree in Chemical Biology at College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, Peking University in 2019.
