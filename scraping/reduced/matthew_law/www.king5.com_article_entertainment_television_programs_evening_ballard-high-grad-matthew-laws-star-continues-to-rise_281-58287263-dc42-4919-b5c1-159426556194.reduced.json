While he was a middle school student in Seattle, he was introduced to the work of legendary filmmakers like Alfred Hitchcock. But it was the film program at Ballard High School that gave him his first shot of making something of his own. \"I learned how to use Final Cut Pro. I started editing things, my friends would skate. I would shoot skate videos for them,\" said Law. \"For the next 10 years, all I knew about storytelling I learned at Ballard High.\" Credit: NFFTY Matthew Law credits Ballard High School for giving him his foundation for filmmaking. Law continued his love of filmmaking into college. After moving to LA he gained notoriety for an immersive short film series called, \" TRUE. \" \"It did well, and went to Slam Dance and went to the Pan African Film Festival and became Oscar qualified,\" he said. But Law wasn't content with just being behind the camera. He also set his sights on being in front of it - as an actor. \"I really found my way to the craft, and eventually got into classes, eventually got an agent,\" he said. He's landed acting parts in shows like the Star Wars series, \" Ahsoka ,\" and the JLo film, \" This Is Me Now.\" But his biggest acting break came recently after he auditioned for a part in the Emmy-winning comedy series, \" Abbott Elementary. \" \"There was an opportunity to audition for this character who was an IT technician. And I put it on tape and thought about it, you know, all day, every day,\" said Law. \"I really wanted this one, you know, I think it's the best show on TV. I am thoroughly a fan. So, I got the news, and it was, I was over the moon.\" Law says walking onto the \"Abbott Elementary\" set was like the first day of school all over again. Credit: ABC Ballard High Grad Matthew Law plays an I-T Tech on Season 4 of Abbott Elementary \"They're four seasons deep, so it's like a varsity team, and you're coming in like walking on.\" Law said. \"They have such a rhythm; they have such a language. And I think it was really a beautiful challenge cause I was there listening and loving it and then like, of wait, I'm also in this!\" From Seattle to Hollywood - Matthew Law hopes his time in the spotlight, has only just begun. \"I'm just going to do my best to make each step as carefully placed, as intentional as possible,\" he said. \"But yes, big dreams. Big dreams.\" You can see Law on Season 4 of Abbott Elementary on ABC and Hulu. KING 5's Evening celebrates the Northwest. Contact us: Facebook , Twitter , Instagram , or Email .
