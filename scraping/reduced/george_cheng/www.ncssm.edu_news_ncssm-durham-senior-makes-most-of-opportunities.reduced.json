(photo provided by George Cheng) news NCSSM-Durham senior makes most of opportunities Brian Faircloth November 20, 2023 Home News NCSSM-Durham senior makes most of opportunities Print Share facebook At 17, George Cheng \u201924 has a resume that belies his age. In just a few years \u2013 since the pandemic, really \u2013 the NCSSM Residential senior from Cary has collected a string of accolades built around his achievements in the classroom and in academic competitions. In between assignments and research, he\u2019s also founded or co-founded two non-profits ( STEMable and Altra ), run cross country and track, and played on NCSSM-Durham\u2019s basketball team. It\u2019s not a bad start \u2013 and it clearly is just a start \u2013 for someone who, as a \u201cchubby little kid,\u201d spent most of his time playing video games. George\u2019s path to NCSSM is familiar to many of the school\u2019s students; by early high school, he had nearly exhausted the course catalog at Green Level High School. Dual-enrollment classes through Wake Technical Community College provided a temporary solution, but George raced through their course catalog fast enough to earn an associate\u2019s degree in science as a 10th-grader. He and his parents considered a virtual school and its broader curriculum to keep his course load full, as well as just graduating high school early. To George, though, neither option felt like the absolute right choice. A close family friend whose daughter had attended NCSSM had another idea; perhaps he should consider applying? The suggestion, George says, was like discovering \u201ca goldmine.\u201d From his tour of the school to his very first days on campus, George knew that NCSSM-Durham was where he belonged. \u201cEveryone here is so supportive,\u201d George says. \u201cAll the [student] ambassadors welcomed me here as I was coming in. Even the chancellor, Dr. [Todd] Roberts, was welcoming. He\u2019s always there, it seems, at every event, greeting students. He actually led the tour I went on when I was applying, and he told me he was actually born here at the school when it was still Watts Hospital. That kind of interpersonal connection that this school\u2019s staff has with its students made it feel like I wasn\u2019t moving away from home. NCSSM has felt like a second home for me.\u201d Unis Up!

His most recent research projects have leaned toward environmental engineering. \u201cI kind of made my dorm a lab,\u201d George says, \u201cand I\u2019ve got so many soil samples around my room from all these different projects that I\u2019ve been a part of at NCSSM.\u201d It hasn\u2019t been all science all of the time. The humanities courses George has taken have broadened his understanding of the world around him, providing a nuance that wasn\u2019t always readily available elsewhere. \u201cI think the Humanities department here is extremely great,\u201d George says. \u201cYou know, while the school might say North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics, it really could be North Carolina School of Science, Mathematics and Humanities.\u201d George has also made time for athletics. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to stay very fit, you know, playing a lot of sports, going to the gym a lot,\u201d he says. \u201cI think one of the key lessons that my dad instilled into me is that sports are just as important as academics and having a healthy body really leads to having a healthy mind.\u201d Now George has been recognized by the Heisman Trophy Trust as a Heisman High School Scholarship National Winner, one of only two scholar-athletes honored each year. It\u2019s George\u2019s research on Type 2 diabetes research, however \u2013 research that began before NCSSM but has, George says, been \u201ccatapulted to great lengths\u201d thanks to the opportunities the school has presented him \u2013 that has by far been the most meaningful experience to him, and for very personal reasons. While pregnant with him, George\u2019s mother developed gestational diabetes, which morphed into Type 2 diabetes. The pain in his mother\u2019s face as she administered her insulin shots is one of George\u2019s most vivid childhood memories. So, too, is the memory of the guilt he felt. \u201cBecause she developed diabetes while pregnant with me, I felt like I was the root cause of it all,\u201d he says. \u201cI felt obligated to solve this problem.\u201d For five years now, George has been deeply immersed in Type 2 diabetes research. Early on he created an oral-fluid glucose-monitoring watch, then later an insulin-delivering patch called DiaMiR that is worn on the skin and delivers product through a carpet of painless microneedles. Much of the work he has done while at NCSSM has been completed as independent research, often traveling by bus to UNC-Chapel Hill after classes to continue his investigations. The research has carried George to research fairs and academic competitions around the United States such as the Regeneron International Science and Engineering Fair, and even to Belgium where he participated in the European Union Contest for Young Scientists. At the European Union Contest for Young Scientists in Brussels, Belgium, George got to share his research with jury member scientists from throughout Europe like Professor Milan Macek Jr. MD, DSc, the chairman of the largest academic medical/molecular genetics institution in the Czech Republic and, among other titles, the Vice President of the European Society of Human Genetics.

Most cherished, he says, are the opportunities that each competition has provided him to move his research forward. \u201cAt the competitions and science fairs, people say, \u2018Maybe you should try this,\u2019 or \u2018Maybe you should test that.\u2019 And every single time I return home, I take out my notebook and I write down all their comments and I use them to try to improve my project,\u201d George says. \u201cOver time, this has allowed my project to evolve from something that was very simple to something that might actually one day be used by millions of people around the world.\u201d George hopes to deliver that relief himself as a biotech entrepreneur; already he has filed a provisional patent on DiaMiR, the anti-diabetes patch. The prototype glucose-monitoring watch he created remains part of his future plans as well. For his mother, they\u2019re reminders of a son\u2019s love. \u201cWhen I first explained all the scientific stuff to my mom about the watch and the research I\u2019ve done, she didn\u2019t really understand, but she was still moved to tears,\u201d George says. \u201cShe probably never expected a son who played a lot of video games all day to one day flip a switch and tackle this problem. I think she was really proud.\u201d George feels an equivalent sense of gratitude for what NCSSM-Durham has allowed him. \u201cI always tell my parents that everyone here is incredible,\u201d he says. \u201cNo matter what I\u2019ve been interested in, I\u2019ve always had a very strong support system of staff and students there to back me up, and to help me through my different classes. NCSSM has provided me with so many different opportunities, and I\u2019m very appreciative of the staff environment, and the creative freedom that I\u2019ve had here.\u201d",
