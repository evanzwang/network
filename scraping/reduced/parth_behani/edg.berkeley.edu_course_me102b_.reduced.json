  "main_content": "Mechatronics Design ME102B provides students with an opportunity to integrate mechanical and electrical systems to create \u201csmart\u201d mechatronics devices. Over the course, students become familiar with event-driven programming, common machine elements, and electromechanical actuators with drive electronics. The course culminates in an Inventor\u2019s Open House where students demonstrate their projects. This page highlights these projects. An archive of project videos from all years (that Prof. Stuart taught the class) can be found on the class channel of Youtube playlists . More information about each semester provided below, including project reports. 2024 Fall Semester This slideshow requires JavaScript. This year\u2019s Showcase was hosted in Jacobs Hall room 310 on Wednesday 12/11 from 4-5:30 pm. Once again, student projects were partially funded by the ASME MakerGrant program . During the live Showcase, a set of impartial judges selected award winners from among the class. The categories and awardees are: Mechanical Design Award : Team 9 (runner up: 3 and 16) Electromechanical Design (MEECS) Award : Team 7 (runner up: 13) Design Innovation Award : Team 8 (runner up: 11) Societal Impact Award : Team 10 (runner up: 12) Commercial Value Entrepreneurship Award : Team 26 (runner up: 32) A playlist of video descriptions created for each project can be viewed at this Youtube playlist .

The showcase occurred on Wednesday, 12/8/2021 from 12-1:30pm at Jacobs Hall room 310 . Attendees were able to witness the ingenuity and skill of our amazing mechanical engineering students! The event was live and in-person. This semester, half of the class consisted of individual labs and assignments in order to learn specific mechatronics skills. Therefore, the project represents the second half of the semester\u2019s work, to deepen and apply lessons in a more integrated product. This semester was also the debut of the ASME MakerGrant system, led by students in the ASME student group, which provided students with funding to help support their project realization. During the live Showcase, a set of impartial judges selected award winners from among the class. The winners were: Mechanical Design Award : Group 7, LightDisc Electromechanical Design (MEECS) Award : Group 12, Billiard Robot Design Innovation Award : Group 16, Domino Placer Societal Impact Award : Group 17, Assistive Cabinet Commercial Value Entrepreneurship Award : Group 10, Icarus Solar Seeker See below for the complete set of reports and videos submitted by students this year.

The teaching team included Prof. Stuart, Prof. Kazeooni and GSI Joseph Skelley. The majority of this class consisted of lab assignments using a home lab kit. This MicroKit is a newly developed tool, featured on the front page of the first ever ME Dept. Newsletter . Then, the mini-project was conducted over the last 3 weeks of class. The students chose to either produce a rough mechatronics product at home (PDF + video) or produce a more detailed mechanical design in CAD (PDF only). These projects are a part of the Jacobs Winter Design Showcase . The Jacob\u2019s staff would like you to be able to connect with the students: \u201c Help provide student feedback and nominate your favorite projects for our Student Projects page, using our feedback form \u2013 all are welcome to submit! \u201d This form is a great way to celebrate the wonderful achievements of the students and let them know if you were impressed with their work. Students are also encouraged to apply for the Jacobs Institute Innovation Catalysts program to get a \u201cSpark\u201d or \u201cIgnite\u201d grant to continue working on their ideas!
