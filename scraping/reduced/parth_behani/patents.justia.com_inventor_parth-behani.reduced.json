Touchless system to be installed for the user control of the elevator based on QR codes and mobile application Publication number: 20210094796 Abstract: The number of bacteria present on an elevator button is almost 40 times higher than on a public toilet seat. An elevator that requires no physical contact is the answer. Just by the use of the mobile-phone, the transmission of diseases and viruses will be enormously reduced. The first part of the system is the motion sensors on the outside of the elevator, which are used to summon the elevator (up or down). The second part is an app. With the typing of desired floor number, the app generates a QR code which then scan the QR scanner inside the elevator. Lastly there is the Universal Communication Unit which translates the info taken in by the QR scanner and sends it to the operating system for the elevator to then trigger the correct response. Type: Application Filed: September 26, 2019 Publication date: April 1, 2021 Applicant: Innowaytors LLC Inventors: Faizan Mirza, Hamza Azeez, Parth Behani, Mollie Hamman, Taifur Rehman, Ayushi Sinha, Aaira Syed, Mustafa Syed, Yaseen Syed, Rizwan Mirza Ask a Lawyer Get Free Answers Have a legal question?
