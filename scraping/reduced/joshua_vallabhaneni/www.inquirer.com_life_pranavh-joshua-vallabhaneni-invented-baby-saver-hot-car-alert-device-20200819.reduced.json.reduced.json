MORENO / Staff Photographer by Marc Narducci Updated Aug. 19, 2020, 10:05 a.m. ET | Published Aug. 19, 2020, 9:00 a.m. ET Pranavh Joshua Vallabhaneni and his family were preparing for a new addition \u2014 Pranavh\u2019s baby brother \u2014 and it got his inventive juices flowing. \u201cMy parents were shopping for car seats and other baby products,\u201d said Pranavh, 15, who is entering his sophomore year at Unionville High School in Kennett Square. \u201cI realized that there was a lot of emphasis on child safety.\u201d Advertisement He said during that same time, he kept hearing tragic stories regarding babies being left in hot cars. \u201cI started to think about why, and how to help prevent the issue,\u201d Pranavh said. His brother, Jayden, is now 4, and Pranavh has worked tirelessly since before Jayden\u2019s birth to help prevent car deaths among young kids. According to kidsandcars.org , more than 940 children have died in hot cars nationwide since 1990, including 53 in 2019. \u201cThe most tragic part is that over 50% of hot-car child deaths have happened because of parents forgetting their children in cars,\u201d Pranavh said. \u201cForgetting can happen to anyone. I couldn\u2019t imagine a tragedy like this happening in my family.\u201d So he began inventing and came up with the Baby Saver \u2014 Hot Car Alert Device. \u201cThere was a lot of experimentation that took place to get to the finished model,\u201d he said. The device sends different automated alerts to parents and local authorities when the temperature inside the car crosses certain thresholds. At the first threshold, an alert will be sent to the parents\u2019 mobile devices. At the second threshold, a buzzer will sound in the car, drawing attention to the vehicle. At the third threshold, an alert will be sent to local authorities, providing GPS coordinates of the vehicle and letting them know of the potentially fatal condition inside of it. The temperature thresholds are easily configurable in the software and can be adjusted based on geographic location, according to Pranavh. He started developing the concept as a CYO (create your own) experiment in his science class and kept expanding upon it. Last month, his creation was lauded at the Invention Convention Worldwide, a global K-12 education program that teaches students problem-identification, problem-solving, entrepreneurship, and creativity skills. This year more than 120,000 student inventors competed at local affiliate events. Pranavh was among 453 inventors who advanced to compete in the Invention Convention Nationals. He was among 63 students to receive awards during the 2020 Virtual Awards Ceremony on July 2: He scored f irst place among ninth grade competitors, and first place for the safety award. \u201cTo get recognized is an honor,\u201d he said. \u201cI am really grateful to have an opportunity to showcase my invention on a national level.\u201d Invention Convention Worldwide is a program of t he Henry Ford Museum of American Innovation in Dearborn, Mich. \u201cAgain, we are beyond impressed by the inventiveness and creativity of young inventors from throughout the country,\u201d said Lucie Howell, chief learning officer at the museum. \u201cPranavh is a shining example of what determination and innovative problem-solving can achieve, not to mention the importance of invention education. We are proud to support students like him during their invention process.\u201d As for getting Pranavh getting his invention to the public, there\u2019s work to do. \u201cI am in the process of applying for a provisional patent and a regular patent application,\u201d said Pranavh, who plans to contact car manufacturers and home-security companies to implement the device on a larger scale. \u201cI\u2019m hoping for a commercial version of my invention that would be cost-effective, something a majority of parents and guardians would want to buy.\u201d Until then, just getting this far with his idea has been a thrill for the young scientist. \u201cIt is an amazing feeling, especially seeing how it grew from an idea to a full-blown invention,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope [it] will save lives and make the world a better place.\u201d Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement",
