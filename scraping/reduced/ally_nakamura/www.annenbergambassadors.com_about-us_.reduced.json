Since the first day of my freshman year, I have felt love and compassion from the Annenberg community.

I found some of my first friends in our classes that we shared, and each professor I've had is adamant about helping students improve and learn inside and outside the classroom. I've been so lucky to have been able to join the ACCSA or write stories for the Media Center and Daily Trojan.

Meet Malcolm Ferrouillet Major: Public Relations & Advertising Hometown: New Orleans, Louisiana Graduation Year: 2027 I chose USC Annenberg because of the family feeling when I first walked into the building.

Meet Ava Nicols Major: Journalism Hometown: Manhattan Beach, CA Graduation Year: 2028 I chose Annenberg because I want to be part of a team of staff and students who help create a unique impact in the communication industry and encourage each other to figure out where our skills can be the most helpful. Before I got to USC, I wrote for and led my high school newspaper but I didn\u2019t realize the crucial role journalism plays in the industries aside from print we as humans rely on day-to-day. I remember during my new student orientation there was a panel of Annenberg Ambassadors who each shared their different experiences in the programs they were involved in, classes they took, or things they hoped to accomplish. I especially remembered the undeniably positive and collaborative energy these students radiated, their honesty and their admitting stories of rejection and redirection. Feeling overwhelmed with opportunity, I knew that whatever I decided to join, I hoped to see myself sitting on that panel among other ambitious students at some point too. Over the past few months, I have had the opportunity to write and edit digital content for Annenberg media, take photos, write research articles, interview Olympic athletes, and work with Fortune 500 PR industry leaders through the USC Center for Public Relations. And now starting this semester, I will continue growing while serving as a resource for students, like my first-semester myself, in need of direction about how to make the most of my experience at such a special school. I am continuously overwhelmed by the fact that in just one semester as part of the Trojan family I have developed so much as a communicator and person. I am so grateful to have chosen Annenberg and you should too! Meet Maria Laguna Major: Journalism Hometown: Coronado, CA Graduation Year: 2028 Annenberg is a thriving community of ambitious creatives and its innovative immersion into the journalism industry makes it the perfect place for me to prepare for my future career in media!

Enrolling in COMM 321 on a whim opened my eyes to the dynamic world of communication and media, and I immediately knew I was in the right place. From hands-on learning opportunities to a collaborative and inspiring community, Annenberg has given me the tools to grow both academically and professionally. I\u2019m grateful for everything I\u2019ve gained here and excited to help others find their own paths within this incredible school. Meet Olivia Hau Major: Journalism Hometown: Palo Alto, CA Graduation Year: 2027 I chose Annenberg because of the amazing opportunities that the school offers. There is no better place to explore the media landscape than at the heart of LA. The community that I have found at Annenberg, both personally and professionally, have enriched my college experience so much. Meet Cecilia Yu Major: Public Relations and Advertising Hometown: Beijing, China / Charlottesville, VA Graduation Date: 2028 I chose Annenberg because it has been my dream school since freshman year in high school. I've always been interested in PR, communication, and marketing while growing up. After visiting USC and Annenberg for the first time my Junior year, I know this is where I am meant to be. Not just due to the fact that it holds the top PR and Communication program in the country, but also the close-knit community, care, and support all the professors and faculties have for each student. USC is my school, and Annenberg is my home away from home. Meet Lena Palomares Major: Public Relations and Advertising Hometown: Glenwood Springs, CO Graduation Date: 2026 For me, Annenberg has been all about access\u2014to opportunities, to people, and to experiences I never would have found on my own. I\u2019ve gained real, hands-on experience that goes beyond the classroom, and the connections I\u2019ve made here have helped me navigate my career in ways I didn\u2019t expect. It\u2019s not just about what you learn\u2014it\u2019s about actually applying it and having people who support you along the way. That\u2019s why I chose Annenberg.",
