December 19, 2022 By Keith McAleer The Sutardja Center for Entrepreneurship & Technology held its flagship event, Collider Cup, on Dec 9, 2022 at Sibley Auditorium in the Bechtel Engineering Center on the UC Berkeley campus. Ten teams presented their venture projects to an esteemed panel of judges to vie for the Collider Cup and prizes, including guaranteed entry to SkyDeck\u2019s Pad-13 program, as well as $10,000 in Amazon AWS credits for the top three teams. 1st place \u2013 LineBy Team LineBy posing with Collider Cup and judges. From left to right: Michael Greenberg, Riddhi Khanna, Ewelina Burri, Ganesh Pimpale, Harsha Gundala and Jay Onda Team: Ganesh Pimpale, Ewelina Burri & Harsha Gundala Course: Challenge Lab | How to Think Like an Entrepreneur: The Unspoken Rules of Navigating the Future of Work Team LineBy, founded in the future of work Challenge Lab course, was the first place winner for the Fall 2022 Collider Cup. The team wants to capture part of the $20B content creator market, by helping creatives more easily create videos by narrating their video story \u201cline-by-line\u201d to an AI. The AI will then find relevant video clips and automatically string together a video, which promises to save video editors a ton of time vs. traditional timeline-based video editing software such as Final Cut Pro or Adobe Premiere. 2nd place \u2013 Frida Team Frida and judges. From left to right: Michael Greenberg, Riddhi Khanna, Jashan Pabla, Lingke Song, Shikha Shah, Jahnavi Jambholkar, Joergen Jore and Jay Onda Team: Jahnavi Jambholkar, Shikha Shah, Jashan Pabla, Lingke Song & Joergen Jore Course: Technology Entrepreneurship Team Frida, founded in the Technology Entrepreneurship course, is a platform that helps women build wealth through coaching and financial literacy. Never before in human history have women had access to so much wealth, but women do not invest as readily as men. Frida seeks to change that by offering a platform where financial influencers will help women become financially literate through workshops and bite-sized courses. 3rd place \u2013 Outwork Team Outwork and judges. From left to right: Michael Greenberg, Riddhi Khanna, Chandler Supple, Cameron Britt and Jay Onda Team: Chandler Supple & Cameron Britt Course: Marketing for Technology Startups It\u2019s easy to imagine the manufacturing industry being filled with large-scale high-tech factories that are leveraging automation to be extremely efficient. According to team Outwork, that is far from the truth, with 99% of manufacturing still being very small and reliant on pen and paper. To address the paper traveler problem, team Outwork, developed in the SCET Marketing for Technology Startups course, created a fully-automated system that uses AI to track part production more accurately than humans and save nearly 30 minutes of time per worker per day. Most Innovative \u2013 Bosch Team Bosch and judges. From left to right, Michael Greenberg, Riddhi Khanna, Carlos Karve, Katell Guillou and Jay Onda Team: Carlos Karve, Jovon Lim, Katell Guillou, Mahnum Khan & Daniela Gonzalez Course: Deplastify the Planet: How to Master the Sustainable Transition Around 18 billion electronic control units (ECU) for vehicles are produced annually creating nearly 1.8 million tons of non-recyclable plastic. Team Bosch re-designed the ECU to create a circular solution by using thread fasteners and snap-on design to make the plastic recyclable and by creating collection hubs near scrapyards to enable easier recycling. People\u2019s Choice Award \u2013 SOPet Team SOPet and judges. From left to right: Michael Greenberg, Riddhi Khanna, Chawin Viriyasopon, and Jay Onda Team: Chawin Viriyasopon Course: Startup Acceleration Everyone loves their pet and more and more are seeking personalized consultation with unbiased and specialized vets to make sure their furry friends can live the best lives possible. SOPet is leveraging artificial intelligence to provide algorithmic consultation and referral to real vets in order to access the huge and growing pets market, which in the US grew by more than 20% in 2021 to a market size of $123B. More Collider Cup XI teams While not every team can win the Collider Cup, these teams also presented innovative solutions that have the potential to solve big problems for consumers. Mint Course: Product Management Team: Zach Dive, Julia Pecego, Kelly Ye & Lucas Monjal What it is: Mint is seeking to change the way consumers connect with food by connecting them with local farms to acquire on-demand produce. Sharapp Course: Disaster Technology: Creating Innovative Solutions to Environmental Change Challenge Lab Team: H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Kondratieff & Paola Noun What it is: Sharapp enables the sharing of resources such as tents or kayaks, so those without a lot of space or money can more easily do recreational activities. WorkerBee Course : Connected Life: How Mobile/AI/Internet of Things Will Improve Our Lives Team: Sergio Mazariegos, Evelyn Tran, Wish Wang, Chanon Sirimontaporn & Sophie Lai What it is: There is still a severe shortage of workers in the hospitality industry, where currently there are 2 job openings for every one worker seeking employment. WorkerBee seeks to connect skilled hospital professionals with flexible on-demand work through its WorkerBee platform. Consolimate Course: Berkeley Method of Entrepreneurship Bootcamp Team: Rick Cruz, Vuk Perisec, Matt Aini, Rachel Lin & Bam Goshtasbi What it is: 37 million people lose their wallet annually. Consolimate keeps track of lost credit cards and re-connects you with your subscription services if your cards are lost or stolen. Collider Cup features one venture project from each of its courses every semester. While teams chosen for the Collider Cup were chosen for a reason and certainly are some of the most innovative, it is still important to recognize that SCET is not able to showcase every team, but there are more than one hundred projects produced in SCET classes each semester. SCET Teaching Awards SCET\u2019s courses feature hands-on, experiential learning guided by experienced instructors, who provide expert feedback to help students develop their ideas. In addition to 16 faculty, SCET hires graduate student instructors (GSIs) and course coordinators to run the classes and ensure student innovators have the best environment to learn. In addition to acknowledging our entire teaching staff, SCET gave special recognition to an instructor and course coordinator at Collider Cup XI. Best Instructor Award This semester\u2019s SCET Best Instructor Award went to Mark Searle, instructor for ENGIN: 198-3: Startup Acceleration. \u201cTruly one of the best classes I have taken and very uniquely enables students to make quick and necessary changes to their pre-existing startups as he makes himself widely available and gives advice from his personal experience, people he is connected to, and shines light on valuable points from other students in the class. Additionally, the environment that he creates where students feel comfortable to discuss their challenges while still getting presentation experience is invaluable.\u201d \u2013 Student in Startup Acceleration Best Course Coordinator Award This semester\u2019s SCET Best Course Coordinator Award , went to Sejal Goel, for her work as a course coordinator, also in the ENGIN: 198-3: Startup Acceleration course. Sejal Goel, Ken Singer and Jesse Dieker Spring Course Preview While judges were deliberating, SCET also presented a preview of its Spring 2023 courses , which are currently open for enrollment for Berkeley students.
