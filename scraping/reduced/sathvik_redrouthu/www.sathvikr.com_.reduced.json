  "main_content": "Welcome to Sathvik Redrouthu's homepage! With Paul Graham\u2014author, On Lisp (1993) ; creator, Arc (a Lisp dialect). I graduated highschool in June 2024, but decided not to attend university. Instead, I created Instachip , an EDA start-up company, and decided to go through a program called Y Combinator. I worked on chip design tooling for a bit, but decided to drop out of the Y Combinator program and join a chip company called Etched. Concurrently, I am working on Formal Verification research with Dr. Mark Santolucito at Columbia University. Beyond foundational mathematics knowledge from Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, I am self-taught via textbooks and projects. I was inspired by Code.org when I was 7. When I was 10, I taught myself basic Combinatorics, Statistics, Algebra I and II, and Geometry, created video game sprites for Super Smash Flash 2, and sat-in on Trigonometry classes at Virginia Polytechnic University. When I was 12, I wrote my first toy interpreter, fostering an interest in programming language theory. I enjoy finding excuses to build interpreters (e.g., I built a custom programming language for Etched's Vestaboards, which are mini Smartboards). Prior to Instachip, my Verilog community contributions include the Verilog Package Manager and the Verilog Module Registry . At TJ, I Designed/taped out three small chips (O(1) matrix-vector multiplication, Vector Processing Unit (US18119437) concept, and more) Designed and implemented a programming language for optical computers - a tensor algebra DSL that compiles to an optical processor with better sparse tensor storage than NumPy Created a Regex interpreter using Brzozowski derivatives (my favorite project) See more projects!! Favorite book: Perfectly Reasonable Deviations from the Beaten Track by Richard Feynman. His letter to Arline Greenbaum, sixteen months after her death. \"I love my wife. My wife is dead.\" Contact me: sathvik@etched.com",
