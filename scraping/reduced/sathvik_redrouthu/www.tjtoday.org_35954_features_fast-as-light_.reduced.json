  "main_content": "As fast as light Juniors Steven Lu, Dhruv Anurag, Sathvik Redrouthu, Pranav Velleleth and Pranav Vadde are part of Procyon\u2019s team. Because Procyon involves developing applications of physics, members are able to use their knowledge in a real-world way. \u201cI feel like Procyon is a place where I can really nerd out, because in AP Physics you\u2019re limited to all these textbook problems,\u201d junior Ryan Kim said. \u201cBut in Procyon, I can design things.\u201d Laura Zhang , Team Leader December 6, 2022 No computer can be faster than light, but a group of Jefferson students are trying to come close to this limit. Procyon is a student-led organization focused on photonics, the scientific study of the applications of light. \u201cI created Procyon sort of on a whim, since I wanted to see if we could build a light speed computer. We thought, \u2018What if we make one that uses lasers?\u2019\u201d junior Sathvik Redrouthu said. Guided by this question, Redrouthu began to explore the possibilities surrounding photonics. As he learned more about the field, he realized that a laser-powered computer could be useful. \u201cConventional computers are powered by electricity, but our computer uses lasers because lasers are faster than electricity,\u201d Redrouthu said. \u201cThey have no heat and are completely cool systems.\u201d Procyon aims to mass produce photonic chips that can be used in all computers. So far, they have built a computer chip and a programming language to run computations on the chip. \u201cIn the past year, we designed a silicon microchip that is able to compute matrix multiplication and tensor algebra,\u201d junior Ryan Kim said. \u201cWe\u2019re the first organization in the world to run tensor algebra on an optical chip.\u201d Because photonics is a relatively new field, it provides many opportunities for new discoveries. Redrouthu predicts that photonics will expand and have a greater impact on computers. \u201cI learned that photonics has a lot more potential than I realized. I know a lot of big companies, like Google and IBM, are trying to push towards photonics,\u201d Redrouthu said. \u201cI feel like in the future, it\u2019s going to quickly take over electronics.\u201d From an idea to a physical chip, Procyon has come a long way. Redrouthu hopes to continue their work and eventually reach a scale where they could support other companies running algorithms on Procyon\u2019s system. \u201cI think we\u2019ve made pretty cool progress,\u201d Redrouthu said. \u201cThere were four months where we had no idea what to do, but we had a breakthrough and were able to design the chip.\u201d Despite the challenges, Redrouthu remains optimistic about Procyon\u2019s development. He encourages other students to pursue projects they are interested in, even if they don\u2019t have much previous experience with the topic. \u201cThe main thing that I\u2019ve learned is that you shouldn\u2019t let what you know now stop you from doing anything in the future,\u201d Redrouthu said. \u201cEven if you\u2019re 16, you can take advantage of what\u2019s around you and do really cool things.\u201d Features computer light Optics physics technology Leave a Comment Trending Stories Freshmen should be able to choose their generation \u2022 837 Views Top 13 of 2023: Pop Singers \u2022 681 Views Mickey Mouse has finally turned 100 years old \u2022 350 Views A not so seemingly shut and dry case in \u201812 Angry Men\u2019 (1957) \u2022 222 Views Benefits of binge-watching \u2022 208 Views This error message is only visible to WordPress admins Error: No feed found.
