Spanish translations were created with help from Ricardo Osorio, Diego Quintana Licona, Katarina Martillo, Luisa Figueredo Atilano, and Andrew Varga. This app represents a continued development from: Djonlagic IE, Guo M, Igue M, Kishore D, Stickgold R, Malhotra A. CPAP Restores Declarative Memory Deficit in Obstructive Sleep Apnea. AJRCCM 2021 May 1;203(9):1188-1190 https://doi.org/10.1164/rccm.202011-4253LE . In brief, this app is designed to test sleep-dependent memory via semantically associated word pairs. There are two modes, training and testing. In our use case, participants complete the training mode in the evening, and the testing mode in the morning after a nights sleep. Training In training mode each word pair is displayed for several seconds, before moving on to the next pair. After viewing all pairs, the participant is then presented with a repeatable training test. In this test the participant is provided with feedback on if their answer is correct. The participant is asked to repeat this training test until achieving at least 60 percent of correct word pairs. After each test a csv file with the percent correct word pairs (scoring ignores letter case and leading/trailing spaces), meta information, and participant answers is downloaded. Testing This mode tests the participant without revealing the correct answer after each entry. The test is not repeatable. At the end of the test a csv file with the percent correct word pairs (scoring ignores letter case and leading/trailing spaces), meta information, and participant answers is downloaded. The primary outcome is the difference between the percent of correct word pairs during the morning test vs the final evening test. How to Use the SD-VPA App If you would like to use this app as is, you can simply use one of our existing deployments. Version 1.0: https://ucsdmalhotra.github.io/word-pairs-associate-2023-built/ Original version, mimicking very closely the original application used in Dr Djonlagic's study (see above). Contains 3 word lists (for legacy reasons called \"List One\", \"List Three\", and \"List Five\") to facilitate a baseline assessment followed by up to 2 follow up assessments. Difficulty level of lists may vary, thus randomization of the order in which participants complete the lists is strongly advised. Version 2.0: https://sd-vpa-task-v2.netlify.app/ Major differences compared with version 1.0: The original App used in Dr Djonlagic's study (see above) gave participants 10 seconds to enter the queried word pair, and after the 10 seconds were over delayed the time-out by 1 second after each key stroke to allow participants finishing the word that they are typing (i.e., extra time for slow typers). Version 1.0 had a hard cut-off after 10 seconds, whereas version 2.0 has the delayed time out built in. In addition to the original 3 word lists, we added three new ones (\"ALZ-OSA List One\", \"ALZ-OSA List Three\u201d, and \"ALZ-OSA List Five\"); note, while the original three lists are based on semantically related word-pairs, the 3 new lists contain word pairs that are not semantically related. The excel sheet which summarizes the results of each training/test run includes an extra row to indicate for each pair whether the answer was correct (0 No, 1 Yes). Version 2.1 : https://sd-vpa-task-v2-1.netlify.app/ Major differences compared with version 2.0: For each of the original three lists using semantically related word pairs (i.e., List One, List Three, and List Five) there is now a Spanish version, which were created with the help of several native speakers from Spain, Mexico and Columbia (for attributions please see the App website) who performed a back-and-forth translation. The csv files now include the version number (i.e., the header of column E lists now \"Training/Testing V2.1\u201d).
