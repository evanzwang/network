The neurodegenerative disease, often correlated with aging, develops through gradual neuronal impairment, in\ue6c0ammation and \ue6bfnally apoptosis. While the cause of the disease is still unknown, research has shown the importance of neurotrophic factors in the survival and proliferation of neurons. More recently, it has been discovered that a strong correlation exists between levels of speci\ue6bfc neurotrophic factors and the progression of Alzheimer\u2019s Diseases [2]. Neurotrophic factors are essential proteins that help aid the central nervous system in developing through promoting neuronal survival, plasticity and differentiation [3]. Their levels are notably high during prenatal and early developmental stages of life; however, over time, their levels signi\ue6bfcantly decrease [4]. There have been multiple hypotheses posed stating: when administered to mouse models with Alzheimer\u2019s Diseases, select few neurotrophic factors have been able to treat the disease; however, many of these treatments have had signi\ue6bfcant side ef fects, impractical treatment applications or have shown con\ue6c0icting results [5]. This paper aims to expel all doubts by examining the progression of the disease and how neurotrophic factors can be effectively used as therapeutics for the disease Additionally, current treatments involving neurotrophic administer a speci\ue6bfc neurotrophic factor directly into the central nervous system and as a result, can be very expensive and dangerous [6]. While treatments involving neurotrophic factors may ameliorate symptoms, without clinical viability and ease of access to the general these treatments won\u2019t be as bene\ue6bfcial as one may hope. Examining alternate ways of delivering treatments must be done to develop the most ef\ue6bfcacious result. Methodology A literature search was conducted through the use of Google Scholar. Information on Alzheimer\u2019s Diseases pathology, neurotrophic factors and Nano therapies was \ue6bfltered for. Results The search yielded a large amount of research that showed promise for the potential applications of nano-therapy. Through the comprehension of the factors causing Alzheimer\u2019s Diseases, the signi\ue6bfcance of neurotrophic factors becomes evident. Discussion Alzheimer\u2019s Diseases Pathology The progression of Alzheimer\u2019s is slow , gradual and can often be deadly. In a patient with Alzheimer\u2019 s, neural degeneration and death are present throughout the brain but especially extensive in the entorhinal cortex and the hippocampus, two regions in the brain associated with memory [5]. This leads to patients exhibiting symptoms of memory loss, problem solving and dif\ue6bfculty completing familiar tasks [7]. While the amount of work put into researching Alzheimer\u2019 s Disease has led to fruitful results when concerning symptoms and adverse effects, scientists are yet to fully uncover the cause of the disease. However, they have managed to determine three hypotheses that have become widely accepted today: the Cholinergic Hypothesis, the Amyloid Beta (A\u03b2) Hypothesis and the T au Hypothesis [5]. The cholinergic hypothesis postulates that the degeneration of the cholinergic neurons, found in the nucleus basalis of Meynert (known as cholinergic NbM neurons) and send axonal projections to the rest of the brain, leading to the formation of neuro\ue6bfbrillary Father Michael McGivney Catholic Academy , Ontario, Canada ABSTRACT Alzheimer\u2019 s diseas e is a neur o degenera tive disorder a\ue61fecting millions across the world.

Normally, these neurons would release an essential neurotransmitter, acetylcholine (ACh) - a neurotransmitter responsible for memory and learning - however, due to their degeneration they severely decrease the amount of AcH found in the brain [8]. Due to the many projections of cholinergic NbM neurons, it means that the loss of AcH can have far-reaching ef fects on the rest of the brain. Animal models show that cholinergic neurodegeneration leads to A\u03b2 and T au tangle formation. A\u03b2 speci\ue6bfcally, further decreased the activity of choline acetyltransferase, the enzyme that synthesizes acetylcholine [9]. Both A\u03b2 and tau are known to also increase Acetylcholinesterase levels, a hydrolase that breaks down acetylcholine after an action potential [10]. Drugs such as donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine are administered to patients with Alzheimer\u2019s Diseases because they counteract the increased Acetylcholinesterase through inhibition leaving more acetylcholine in the body [11]. The Amyloid Beta hypothesis suggests that the buildup of A\u03b2 starts the process of degeneration. It starts with the dysregulation of prolyetic processing of the precursor to A\u03b2, amyloid precursor protein (APP) [5]. APP is a transmembrane glycoprotein that promotes synapse formation and neural plasticity [12]. There are two pathways that the protein can go through, the amyloidogenic and non-amyloidogenic pathways [5]. Current research is unclear as to how these pathways are regulated; however, studies have proposed that APP is self-regulated through its YENPTY domain [13]. The non-amyloidogenic pathway is the normal pathway that causes no harm. The amyloidogenic pathway , on the other hand, cleaves APP in a way that produces A\u03b2. The enzymes that cleave the protein include \u03b1-secretase, \u03b2-secretase and \u03b3-secretase. Gamma secretase generates either A\u03b2 that is 39 residues (A\u03b240) or 43(A\u03b242) residues in length, the hydrophobic nature of A\u03b242 makes it more \ue6bfbrillogenic and harmful to neurons. Amyloidogenic mouse models have also found that the overproduction of A\u03b2 promotes tau hyperphosphorylation, another key hallmark of AD. This results in signi\ue6bfcant impairment in axonal transport. While scientists are yet to fully understand why it happens to speci\ue6bfc demographics of people compared to others, they have discovered that Apolipoprotein E4 is a major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer\u2019s Diseases as it promotes A\u03b2 plaques [5]. The tau hypothesis predicates that tau is the driving force behind the progression of Alzheimer\u2019s. The core reasoning for this is due to the fact that hyper phosphorylation of tau is often the \ue6bfrst sign of AD before amyloid formation or choliner gic neurodegeneration. However, this does not mean that A\u03b2 plaque formation is dependent on T au hyper phosphorylation since amyloid plaques without tau tangles have been found in patients that did not have Alzheimer\u2019s Diseases [5]. Tau is a microtubule-associated protein and promotes the growth of microtubules that maintain the structure of the neuron. When tau is hyperactive phosphorylated by either cyclin- dependent kinase 5(CDK-5) or glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 (GSK- 3\u03b2) the tau forms neuro\ue6bfbrillary tangles, lose their function and result in apoptosis in the neuron [14]. Neurotrophic factors are small molecules found throughout the brain that are essential to the survival and function of neurons. Neurotrophic factors can be classi\ue6bfed into 3 main groups: neurotrophins, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor family of ligands(GFLs) and neurokines [2]. The neurotrophin family consists of nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin- 3(NT -3) and neurotrophin-4(NT -4). They are \ue6bfrst synthesized as proneurotrophins, packed into vessels and are then cleaved of their N-terminal peptide and C-terminal mature protein(denoted by the pre\ue6bfx \u201cmature-\u201d) [2]. These proneurotrophins(denoted by the pre\ue6bfx \u201cpro-\u201d) are known to activate pathways associated with the p75 neurotrophin receptor inducing neuronal apoptosis. This is useful during the early stages of life for growth cone retraction [15]. NGF maintains function and promotes the development of neurons in the peripheral nervous system and cholinergic neurons in the central nervous system [16]. BDNF mediates hippocampal plasticity - a hallmark of AD. It was found that in patients with AD, pro-BDNF concentration is increased activating apoptotic pathways while mature-BDNF is decreased. BDNF also decreases Amyloid-beta production through the APP Y687 phosphorylation [17]. There is a slight decrease in NT -3, primarily in the motor cortex; however, the cytokine stays relatively unchanged in AD patients. NT -3 is known to protect against the toxicity of Amyloid- beta. Finally , NT -4/5 is known to induce tau dephosphorylation [5]. Another family of neurotrophic factors is the glial-derived neurotrophic factor family of ligands (GFL). This family is composed of GDNF , artemin, persephin, neurturin. GFLs are fundamental for the survival of neurons speci\ue6bfcally in dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain. Most GFLs bind to the GFR\u03b11 to 4 receptors in the brain [2]. The last family of neurotrophic factors is neurokines. While there is a myriad of identi\ue6bfed neurokines, the main ones include ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), cardiotrophin-1(CT -1), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), neuropoietin (NPN). CTNF is important in supporting motor, dopaminergic and parasympathetic neurons while LIF supports sensory neurons [2]. This review will be focusing speci\ue6bfcally on brain-derived neurotrophic factor, as there is signi\ue6bfcantly much more research and potential for treatment with these molecules. BDNF T reatments Brain-derived neurotrophic factor is an important neurotrophin with the potential to treat AD because it interacts with the TrkB receptor, which is directly correlated to a downregulation in amyloid precursor protein. It also dephosphorylates tau through the same TrkB receptor and PI3K-kinase/AKT -dependent mechanisms. Its regulation can be modulated by the CREB promoter however, in Alzheimer\u2019s Diseases, the neurotrophin, along with the TrkB receptor, are found to be downregulated. Other studies have shown that a single nucleotide polymorphism can put individuals at an increased risk of developing AD. If the regulation of BDNF can be controlled in patients with Alzheim er\u2019s Diseases, it may prove as an effective treatment [5]. Tr opomyosin-Related Kinase Receptor B and BDNF When BDNF binds to a TrkB receptor, the kinase dimerizes leading to the activation of 3 intracellular pathways. The \ue6bfrst is the PI3K-kinase/AKT -dependent mechanisms, which promote the survival of a neuron. In vivo studies have shown that de\ue6bfciencies in BDNF have led to an inactivation of this pathway that caused increased apoptosis. It was also found that activation of AKT-dependent mechanisms leads to the inhibition of the p53 tumour suppressor, a gene known to increase the risk of cancer when activated. It must be noted that it is unclear how exactly this activation happens since AKT does not directly phosphorylate p53 [18].

PLC-\u03b3 receptor activates the inositol triphosphate (IP3) receptor which releases intracellular calcium stores. The calcium then activates CAmK, an enzyme that increases synaptic plasticity. Perfusion of BDNF in rat models has been shown to induce long- term potentiation indicating increased synaptic ef\ue6bfcacy [18]. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is activated by Ras small GTP-binding protein, a membrane-bound intracellular molecule. Activation of this pathway is shown to interfere with \u03b2-amyloid production in AD. Through this pathway , BDNF promotes long-term potentiation (L TP) and synaptic growth [18]. Nanotherapy Tr eatments To get to the brain, brain-tar geted drugs must cross the blood- brain barrier (BBB). Unfortunately, BDNF is a molecule that has been proven to be incapable of crossing the BBB and as a result, alternative methods must be used to deliver the treatment. A commonly used treatment for all drugs that cannot cross the BBB is injecting it directly into the spinal cord, an intrathecal injection [19]. This method is often very expensive, dangerous and invasive so for BDNF to be used as a viable treatment, safer, cheaper methods must be developed. A new treatment being developed is binding BDNF to poly (D, L-lactide-co-glycolide acid) PLGA. PLGA is a nanoparticle approved by the Food and drug administration for drug delivery and is very cheap compared to an intrathecal injection. Research has shown that these injections into the cochlea may be a viable method to treat deafness [20]. It was also found that PEG and anti-A\u03b2 Abs-coated CNPs (A\u03b2- CNPs-PEG) nanocarriers can prevent oxidative stress caused by the build-up of A\u03b2 and also stimulate neurogenesis [21]. Conclusion Though nanoparticle drug-delivery trials are still in their early stages, they show great promise to be able to treat Alzheimer\u2019s Diseases. As of today , PEG and PLGA nanocarriers seem to be the most ef\ue6bfcient carriers for increasing BDNF levels in the brain. Successful nanotherapy treatments would allow BDNF to be injected as easily as giving blood. References 1. Alzheimer\u2019s Diseases and Dementia (2022) Alzheimer\u2019 s Disease Facts and Figures.

TrkB receptor cleavage by delta-secretase abolishes its phosphorylation of APP, aggravating Alzheimer\u2019s disease pathologies Article Full-text available Jul 2021 Yiyuan Xia Zhi-Hao Wang Pai Liu Keqiang Ye Neurotrophins promote neuronal survival and synaptic plasticity via activating the tropomyosin receptor kinases. BDNF and its high-affinity receptor TrkB are reduced in Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), contributing to progressive cognitive decline. However, how the signaling mediates AD pathologies remains incompletely understood. Here we show that the TrkB receptor binds and phosphorylates APP, reducing amyloid-\u03b2 production, which are abrogated by \u03b4-secretase cleavage of TrkB in AD. Remarkably, BDNF stimulates TrkB to phosphorylate APP Y687 residue that accumulates APP in the TGN (Trans-Golgi Network) and diminishes its amyloidogenic cleavage. Delta-secretase cleaves TrkB at N365 and N486/489 residues and abolishes its neurotrophic activity, decreasing p-APP Y687 and altering its subcellular trafficking. Notably, both TrkB and APP are robustly cleaved by \u03b4-secretase in AD brains, accompanied by mitigated TrkB signaling and reduced p-Y687. Blockade of TrkB cleavage attenuates AD pathologies in 5xFAD mice, rescuing the learning and memory. Viral expression of TrkB 1-486 fragment in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice facilitates amyloid pathology and mitigates cognitive functions. Hence, \u03b4-secretase cleaves TrkB and blunts its phosphorylation of APP, facilitating AD pathogenesis. View Show abstract Amyloid-\u03b2, tau, and the cholinergic system in Alzheimer\u2019s disease: seeking direction in a tangle of clues Article Full-text available Feb 2020 Alireza Majdi Saeed Sadigh-Eteghad Sepideh Rahigh Aghsan Javad Mahmoudi The link between histopathological hallmarks of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), i.e. amyloid plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles, and AD-associated cognitive impairment, has long been established. However, the introduction of interactions between amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) as well as hyperphosphorylated tau, and the cholinergic system to the territory of descriptive neuropathology has drastically changed this field by adding the theory of synaptic neurotransmission to the toxic pas de deux in AD. Accumulating data show that a multitarget approach involving all amyloid, tau, and cholinergic hypotheses could better explain the evolution of events happening in AD. Various species of both A\u03b2 and tau could be traced in cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain system early in the course of the disease. These molecules induce degeneration in the neurons of this system. Reciprocally, aberrant cholinergic system modulation promotes changes in amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism and tau phosphorylation, resulting in neurotoxicity, neuroinflammation, and neuronal death. Altogether, these changes may better correlate with the clinical findings and cognitive impairment detected in AD patients. Failure of several of A\u03b2- and tau-related therapies further highlights the need for special attention to molecules that target all of these mentioned pathologic changes. Another noteworthy fact here is that none of the popular hypotheses of AD such as amyloidopathy or tauopathy seem to be responsible for the changes observed in AD alone. Thus, the main culprit should be sought higher in the stream somewhere in APP metabolism or Wnt signaling in the cholinergic system of the basal forebrain. Future studies should target these pathological events. View Show abstract The cholinergic system in the pathophysiology and treatment of Alzheimer's disease Article Full-text available May 2018 BRAIN Harald J Hampel M.-Marsel Mesulam Augusto Claudio Cuello Zaven Khachaturian Cholinergic synapses are ubiquitous in the human central nervous system. Their high density in the thalamus, striatum, limbic system, and neocortex suggest that cholinergic transmission is likely to be critically important for memory, learning, attention and other higher brain functions. Several lines of research suggest additional roles for cholinergic systems in overall brain homeostasis and plasticity. As such, the brain's cholinergic system occupies a central role in ongoing research related to normal cognition and age-related cognitive decline, including dementias such as Alzheimer's disease. The cholinergic hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease centres on the progressive loss of limbic and neocortical cholinergic innervation. Neurofibrillary degeneration in the basal forebrain is believed to be the primary cause for the dysfunction and death of forebrain cholinergic neurons, giving rise to a widespread presynaptic cholinergic denervation. Cholinesterase inhibitors increase the availability of acetylcholine at synapses in the brain and are one of the few drug therapies that have been proven clinically useful in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease dementia, thus validating the cholinergic system as an important therapeutic target in the disease. This review includes an overview of the role of the cholinergic system in cognition and an updated understanding of how cholinergic deficits in Alzheimer's disease interact with other aspects of disease pathophysiology, including plaques composed of amyloid-\u03b2 proteins. This review also documents the benefits of cholinergic therapies at various stages of Alzheimer's disease and during long-term follow-up as visualized in novel imaging studies. The weight of the evidence supports the continued value of cholinergic drugs as a standard, cornerstone pharmacological approach in Alzheimer's disease, particularly as we look ahead to future combination therapies that address symptoms as well as disease progression.

Therefore, neurotrophic factor issue has been extensively investigated into the context of neurodegenerative diseases. Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease show changes in the regulation of specific neurotrophic factors and their receptors, which appear to be critical for neuronal degeneration. Indeed, neurotrophic factors prevent cell death in degenerative processes and can enhance the growth and function of affected neurons in these disorders. Based on recent reports, this review discusses the main findings related to the neurotrophic factor support \u2013 mainly brain-derived neurotrophic factor and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor \u2013 in the survival, proliferation and maturation of affected neurons in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease as well as their putative application as new therapeutic approach for these diseases management.

Anderson Abigail S Yu Jan A Nolta Introduction: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been implicated in wide range of neurological diseases and injury. This neurotrophic factor is vital for neuronal health, survival, and synaptic connectivity. Many therapies focus on the restoration or enhancement of BDNF following injury or disease progression. Areas Covered: The present review will focus on the mechanisms in which BDNF exerts its beneficial functioning, current BDNF therapies, issues and potential solutions for delivery of neurotrophic factors to the central nervous system, and other disease indications that may benefit from overexpression or restoration of BDNF. Expert Opinion: Due to the role of BDNF in neuronal development, maturation, and health, BDNF is implicated in numerous neurological diseases making it a prime therapeutic agent. Numerous studies have shown the therapeutic potential of BDNF in a number of neurodegenerative disease models and in acute CNS injury, however clinical translation has fallen short due to issues in delivering this molecule. The use of MSC as a delivery platform for BDNF holds great promise for clinical advancement of neurotrophic factor restoration. The ease with which MSC can be engineered opens the door to the possibility of using this cell-based delivery system to advance a BDNF therapy to the clinic. View Show abstract Targeted delivery of brain-derived neurotrophic factor for the treatment of blindness and deafness Article Full-text available Apr 2015 Igor Khalin Renad Alyautdin Ganna Kocherga Muhamad Abu Bakar Neurodegenerative causes of blindness and deafness possess a major challenge in their clinical management as proper treatment guidelines have not yet been found. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been established as a promising therapy against neurodegenerative disorders including hearing and visual loss. Unfortunately, the blood\u2013retinal barrier and blood\u2013cochlear barrier, which have a comparable structure to the blood\u2013brain barrier prevent molecules of larger sizes (such as BDNF) from exiting the circulation and reaching the targeted cells. Anatomical features of the eye and ear allow use of local administration, bypassing histo-hematic barriers. This paper focuses on highlighting a variety of strategies proposed for the local administration of the BDNF, like direct delivery, viral gene therapy, and cell-based therapy, which have been shown to successfully improve development, survival, and function of spiral and retinal ganglion cells. The similarities and controversies for BDNF treatment of posterior eye diseases and inner ear diseases have been analyzed and compared. In this review, we also focus on the possibility of translation of this knowledge into clinical practice. And finally, we suggest that using nanoparticulate drug-delivery systems may substantially contribute to the development of clinically viable techniques for BDNF delivery into the cochlea or posterior eye segment, which, ultimately, can lead to a long-term or permanent rescue of auditory and optic neurons from degeneration.

The enzyme inactivation, induced by various inhibitors, leads to acetylcholine accumulation, hyperstimulation of nicotinic and muscarinic receptors, and disrupted neurotransmission. Hence, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, interacting with the enzyme as their primary target, are applied as relevant drugs and toxins. This review presents an overview of toxicology and pharmacology of reversible and irreversible acetylcholinesterase inactivating compounds. In the case of reversible inhibitors being commonly applied in neurodegenerative disorders treatment, special attention is paid to currently approved drugs (donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine) in the pharmacotherapy of Alzheimer's disease, and toxic carbamates used as pesticides. Subsequently, mechanism of irreversible acetylcholinesterase inhibition induced by organophosphorus compounds (insecticides and nerve agents), and their specific and nonspecific toxic effects are described, as well as irreversible inhibitors having pharmacological implementation. In addition, the pharmacological treatment of intoxication caused by organophosphates is presented, with emphasis on oxime reactivators of the inhibited enzyme activity administering as causal drugs after the poisoning. Besides, organophosphorus and carbamate insecticides can be detoxified in mammals through enzymatic hydrolysis before they reach targets in the nervous system. Carboxylesterases most effectively decompose carbamates, whereas the most successful route of organophosphates detoxification is their degradation by corresponding phosphotriesterases. View Show abstract Nerve growth factor: From the early discoveries to the potential clinical use Article Full-text available Nov 2012 J TRANSL MED Luigi Aloe Maria Luisa Rocco Patrizia Bianchi Luigi Manni The physiological role of the neurotrophin nerve growth factor (NGF) has been characterized, since its discovery in the 1950s, first in the sensory and autonomic nervous system, then in central nervous, endocrine and immune systems. NGF plays its trophic role both during development and in adulthood, ensuring the maintenance of phenotypic and functional characteristic of several populations of neurons as well as immune cells. From a translational standpoint, the action of NGF on cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain and on sensory neurons in dorsal root ganglia first gained researcher's attention, in view of possible clinical use in Alzheimer's disease patients and in peripheral neuropathies respectively. The translational and clinical research on NGF have, since then, enlarged the spectrum of diseases that could benefit from NGF treatment, at the same time highlighting possible limitations in the use of the neurotrophin as a drug. In this review we give a comprehensive account for almost all of the clinical trials attempted until now by using NGF. A perspective on future development for translational research on NGF is also discussed, in view of recent proposals for innovative delivery strategies and/or for additional pathologies to be treated, such as ocular and skin diseases, gliomas, traumatic brain injuries, vascular and immune diseases. View Show abstract Dysfunction in Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Signaling Pathway and Susceptibility to Schizophrenia, Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer\u2019s Diseases Article May 2018 Alireza Mohammadi Vahid Ghasem Amooeian Ehsan Rashidi Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a dominant neurotrophic factor in the brain which plays a crucial role in differentiation, regeneration and plasticity mechanisms. Binding of the BDNF to its high-affinity tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) receptor leads to phosphorylation of TrkB, thus activating the three important downstream intracellular signaling cascades within the neural cells including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT), phospholipase C-\u03b3 (PLC\u03b3), and mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal related kinase (MAPK/ERK) pathways. Transcription of these pathways is regulated by cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) transcription factor, which can upregulate gene expression. In this review, we attempted to explore the role of BDNF and its associated pathways in susceptibility to Schizophrenia (Scz), Alzheimer's (AD), and Parkinson's (PD) diseases. Furthermore, we discuss dysfunction in BDNF signaling pathway and the therapeutic potential of BDNF in the treatment of these disorders. The review covers various therapeutic strategies including BDNF gene therapy, transplantation of BDNF-expressing cell grafts, epigenetic manipulation, and intraparenchymal BDNF protein infusion as well. This review seeks to achieve these goals by reviewing recent studies on BDNF and examining the details of BDNF pathway in any of the above-mentioned diseases.
