                      JESUIT SCHOOLS NETWORK AWARD
                  The Jesuit Schools Network, or JSN, is the organization of Jesuit high schools in the United States.
                  The JSN Award is presented to two students of the senior class who have worked hard to develop a broad variety of the talents God has given them to build up the Kingdom of God.
                  The Jesuit schools of the United States have created a document called The Profile of the Graduate at Graduation.  All Jesuit high schools strive to educate and nurture graduates who are Open to Growth, Religious Alive, Intellectually Competent, Committed to Justice, and Loving.
                  With this award, we recognize two of this year’s graduates who in the estimation of their classmates and teachers have demonstrated growth in all those qualities in remarkable ways.
