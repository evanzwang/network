                Hello everyone! I’m super excited to be your instructor this semester. I did my undergrad and Masters’ at Berkeley and taught 186 for four semesters as a TA, including a couple as head TA, before graduating and coming back as a lecturer. In my free time, I love to play and watch sports and do political analysis, and I play on the Cal Cricket team. Go bears!
