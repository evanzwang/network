                            Students pitch next generation venture projects at Collider Cup XI
                              Collider Cup XI included innovative projects such as the winner LineBy, a new video editing platform that leverages AI to make video editing easier for creators.

                            [Keith McAleer](https://scet.berkeley.edu/author/1118768/)
                          The Sutardja Center for Entrepreneurship & Technology held its flagship event, Collider Cup, on Dec 9, 2022 at Sibley Auditorium in the Bechtel Engineering Center on the UC Berkeley campus. Ten teams presented their venture projects to an esteemed panel of judges to vie for the Collider Cup and prizes, including guaranteed entry to SkyDeck’s Pad-13 program, as well as $10,000 in Amazon AWS credits for the top three teams.
                          1st place – LineBy

                          Team: Ganesh Pimpale, Ewelina Burri & Harsha Gundala
                          Course: Challenge Lab | How to Think Like an Entrepreneur: The Unspoken Rules of Navigating the Future of Work
                          Team LineBy, founded in the future of work Challenge Lab course, was the first place winner for the Fall 2022 Collider Cup. The team wants to capture part of the $20B content creator market, by helping creatives more easily create videos by narrating their video story “line-by-line” to an AI. The AI will then find relevant video clips and automatically string together a video, which promises to save video editors a ton of time vs. traditional timeline-based video editing software such as Final Cut Pro or Adobe Premiere.
                          2nd place – Frida

                            [Technology Entrepreneurship](https://scet.berkeley.edu/students/courses/technology-entrepreneurship/)
                          Team Frida, founded in the Technology Entrepreneurship course, is a platform that helps women build wealth through coaching and financial literacy. Never before in human history have women had access to so much wealth, but women do not invest as readily as men. Frida seeks to change that by offering a platform where financial influencers will help women become financially literate through workshops and bite-sized courses.
                          3rd place – Outwork
                            Team Outwork and judges. From left to right: Michael Greenberg, Riddhi Khanna, Chandler Supple, Cameron Britt and Jay Onda

                          It’s easy to imagine the manufacturing industry being filled with large-scale high-tech factories that are leveraging automation to be extremely efficient. According to team Outwork, that is far from the truth, with 99% of manufacturing still being very small and reliant on pen and paper. To address the paper traveler problem, team Outwork, developed in the SCET Marketing for Technology Startups course, created a fully-automated system that uses AI to track part production more accurately than humans and save nearly 30 minutes of time per worker per day.
                          Most Innovative – Bosch
                            Team Bosch and judges. From left to right, Michael Greenberg, Riddhi Khanna, Carlos Karve, Katell Guillou and Jay Onda

                          Around 18 billion electronic control units (ECU) for vehicles are produced annually creating nearly 1.8 million tons of non-recyclable plastic. Team Bosch re-designed the ECU to create a circular solution by using thread fasteners and snap-on design to make the plastic recyclable and by creating collection hubs near scrapyards to enable easier recycling.
                          People’s Choice Award – SOPet
                            Team SOPet and judges. From left to right: Michael Greenberg, Riddhi Khanna, Chawin Viriyasopon, and Jay Onda

                          Everyone loves their pet and more and more are seeking personalized consultation with unbiased and specialized vets to make sure their furry friends can live the best lives possible. SOPet is leveraging artificial intelligence to provide algorithmic consultation and referral to real vets in order to access the huge and growing pets market, which in the US grew by more than 20% in 2021 to a market size of $123B.

                          While not every team can win the Collider Cup, these teams also presented innovative solutions that have the potential to solve big problems for consumers.

                          Collider Cup features one venture project from each of its courses every semester. While teams chosen for the Collider Cup were chosen for a reason and certainly are some of the most innovative, it is still important to recognize that SCET is not able to showcase every team, but there are more than one hundred projects produced in SCET classes each semester.
                          SCET Teaching Awards

                            feature hands-on, experiential learning guided by experienced instructors, who provide expert feedback to help students develop their ideas. In addition to 16 faculty, SCET hires graduate student instructors (GSIs) and course coordinators to run the classes and ensure student innovators have the best environment to learn. In addition to acknowledging our entire teaching staff, SCET gave special recognition to an instructor and course coordinator at Collider Cup XI.
                          Best Instructor Award
                          This semester’s
                            SCET Best Instructor Award
                            went to Mark Searle, instructor for ENGIN: 198-3: Startup Acceleration.
                          “Truly one of the best classes I have taken and very uniquely enables students to make quick and necessary changes to their pre-existing startups as he makes himself widely available and gives advice from his personal experience, people he is connected to, and shines light on valuable points from other students in the class. Additionally, the environment that he creates where students feel comfortable to discuss their challenges while still getting presentation experience is invaluable.” – Student in Startup Acceleration
                          Best Course Coordinator Award
                            SCET Best Course Coordinator Award
