    About Me
    Hi, I'm Leo Nagel. My current focus is on GPU kernels, but I am equally fascinated by quantitative finance, computing theory, mathematics, and physics. I'm German and I live in Berkeley, California. I've spent about 8 years of my life in Germany, 10 years in China, and coming up on 2 years in the United States.
    I enjoy playing chess and hiking up the Berkeley Hills (at night, especially).
    Projects
        cuBogo
        Collaborated with
          [Bradley Hsu](https://bradleyhsu.com/)
          to develop the fastest
          [bogosort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogosort)
          implementation (measured by permutations per second) ever run on a single device. This involved optimizing a custom CUDA (C++) kernel for the Nvidia H100, and an article detailing the work is coming soon!
        cuDream
        Rewriting
          [DreamCoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08381)
          to leverage GPU optimizations using CUDA (C++) and PTX. This project aims to make the system significantly faster and more efficient.
        cuPrimes
        Developing a custom kernel to perform the
          [Fermat test of pseudo-primality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat_pseudoprime)
          . This implementation incorporates the
          [Schönhage-Strassen algorithm](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02242355)
          for long integer multiplication and a highly optimized
          [Fast Fourier Transform using Nvidia H100 tensor cores](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.11471)
          .
    Education
        University of California, Berkeley
      B. Sc. in Electrical Engineering & Computer Sciences
        Class of 2025
    Achievements
          Berkeley Trading Invitational 2024:
          Placed first out of 130+ participants in this quantitative finance competition.
            [The Residency](https://www.livetheresidency.com/)
            :
          Participated in Chapter 3 during the summer of 2024.
            [Global Society of Young Physicists](https://www.gsyp.xyz)
          Founded a physics nonprofit that organizes a summer program and publishes a journal in 2022.
