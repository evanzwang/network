                Abstract
                For many falling objects, air resistance can be assumed to be negligible; however, this assumption is not a valid one to make in many cases. Thus, a function relating velocity to time, under consideration of drag, can be used to better estimate the velocity of a falling object.In an idealized sense, two forces act upon a falling object: weight and drag. These two forces can be assumed to act in opposite direction to each other. This means that a simple equation for acceleration based on Newton’s Second Law of Motion can be found, which can then be derived to yield an expression for velocity

                          Free fall motion in air medium is only influenced by gravitation acceleration. However, there are several variables that caused the observations to be different with the concept. Variables, such as air drag and terminal velocity, are often teachers not presented in detail, causing misconceptions. This study aims to develop a simple experiment on free fall motion by identifying air drag and
                            terminal velocity. The data in this study is the video of free fall motion of paper and scraper analyzed using Tracker video analyze. From the video analyzed, information is obtained in the form of time (t), track (l, θ), and velocity (v)
of the object. This study shows that the air drag force increase unto the terminal velocity. The calculation of the drag coefficient giving the number of the paper 2,16 and the scraper 2,10. According to data analyzed, the air drag force is affected by the mass (m), area (A), and the air drag force (FD) with the linear correlation until it reaches the terminal
velocity. The result of this study may use as references of free fall motion experiment with other objects and analyze.

                          This chapter begins with three projects related to Newton's law of acceleration. The first considers what happens when a real ladder slides down a wall with the base pulled out at constant velocity. The second project considers air resistance for an object falling a long distance with the approximation of a linear force because of the air. The third project considers nonlinear air resistance and

It wil be treated for thespecial case of an iron ball with a radius of 10 cm dropped from the tower of Pisa, and then for awooden ball of the same size. The behaviour of the solution is found to be qualitatively similat to thatof
