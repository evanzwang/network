                          How we measure 'reads'
                        A 'read' is counted each time someone views a publication summary (such as the title, abstract, and list of authors), clicks on a figure, or views or downloads the full-text.

                            For many falling objects, air resistance can be assumed to be negligible; however, this assumption is not a valid one to make in many cases. Thus, a function relating velocity to time, under consideration of drag, can be used to better estimate the velocity of a falling object.In an idealized sense, two forces act upon a falling object: weight and...
