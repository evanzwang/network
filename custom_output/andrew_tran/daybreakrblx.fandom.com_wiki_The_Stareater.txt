                    Trivia
                was once an ordinary college student with a future ahead of him. But when a shooting star seemingly pierced his chest one night, he wasn't the same as he was before, and he soon disappeared without a trace. Years had passed when he finally arrived back at his campus, looking pale and almost unrecognizable, feeling an insatiable hunger that grew ever since the incident that night. Andrew realized the only way to satisfy his gnawing appetite was to hunt down his prey for another star.
              And he found the perfect

                The Stareater's
                Active Ability,
                Everything Everywhere At Once
              allows him to create a wormhole. Survivors who approach the wormhole will activate it allowing the
                to teleport to it as long as he is in range.

              makes survivors drop a gem upon being killed. When
                eats the gem he gains several buffs temporarily.
                  The Stareater deploys a
                    wormhole
                    . Survivors who approach the wormhole will
                    activate
                    it for
                    10s
                    . An activated wormhole can be
                    teleported

                    crouch
                    to avoid activating the wormhole. The Stareater can only have
                    wormholes out at a time, with new ones
                    replacing
                    the old ones. After teleporting, The Stareater cannot attack for

                + Wormhole functions as an excellent anti-loop ability due to a meager 0.1s attack CD after teleporting to a wormhole

                - Teleporting to a wormhole mid-chase is disorienting and takes getting used to
              When a star dies, it explodes. The explosion is so powerful it has the potential to recombine elements and create new ones. Yet it all happens so far away, high above in the sky that most people wouldn't think twice about it. Andrew Tran is no exception to that. Once a normal college student, he was always a little self-centered and focused on his own future. But everything changed one autumn night, when he was up late working on a paper.
              A bright ball of energy shot through the window, hitting him directly in the chest. When he went to touch the wound, he found that there was nothing there. He could only sit in stunned silence, his tired eyes serving as a reminder that he hadn't slept in a while. It had to have been some kind of crazy hallucination, no? What else could it be? A shooting star that hit him and left no mark? It was nonsense, so he ignored it.
              But over the weeks he began to change, and when all was said and done he couldn't look in the mirror anymore. Pale skin, pale hair, and a pair of bloodshot eyes that he couldn't recognize anymore. He couldn't allow himself to be seen like this, so he disappeared. Nobody knew what happened to him, and years later everybody was none the wiser when a mysterious looking student enrolled in classes.
              He knew how to put on a front, but he was only as strong as the first star allowed him to be. If one thing was for certain, it was the fact he was getting hungrier with each passing year. An innate desire that no amount of food could satiate, he needed something much stronger.
              He needed another star.
              The first group was the easiest. Bright-eyed students who were none the wiser that their newfound 'powers' were merely the beginning of a plot to lure them in. One by one, the group vanished until there was nobody left to tell their story. But his actions had alerted the other celestial beings, for he was not the only one that the first star had gifted that night.
              Just saying her name puts a sour expression on his face. Dhanya. Dhanya Choudhary. He was the polar opposite of her. The star had blessed her with the powers of light, and everything good in the world. Why did she get to bask in it while he was left to rot in the dark? He wouldn't stand for it. He *couldn't* stand for it. Hunting her down was no easy feat, but once he found her his plan seemed so perfect.
              They called themselves the 'Starcallers,' which he always found to be pathetic. They weren't heroes, they were losers in suits pretending that they could change things. They couldn't, and he had no issues proving it. After the first death, he found that their stars were so much stronger than the ones he had manufactured himself. They invigorated him, and with his newfound strength he was able to wipe them out in one battle. Even with the numbers advantage, they weren't strong enough to stop him.
              Except for her.
              Her determination shone so brightly that even when her body couldn't continue on, her spirit remained. He couldn’t forget the smile on her face as the life slowly left her eyes, because he knew it was nothing more than a threat to him. She did not drop a star for him, because instead he watched as it burst into shattered fragments before vanishing before his very eyes. Even in the end, he was left in darkness once more.
              But he's not ready to call it quits. Not when he's received word that the very first star has landed, and its blonde-haired owner is about to find out her life is not quite what she thought it was. He'll be waiting, ready to show her the reality of the world. Ready to show her what it's like to spend your life locked away in the shadows.
              After all, he's only gotten stronger.

                Andrew is in Daybreakia Academy class 3B.
                Confirmed by Haru, Andrew listens to CBAT by Hudson Mohawke unironically.
                His active ability,
                  is likely a reference to the movie with a
                  [similar name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_Everywhere_All_at_Once)
                Haru has said that The Stareater's design is too "anime" and would wanted to have more body horror.
                    Haru has confirmed this isn't an indication for a redesign.
