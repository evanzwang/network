Audrey Chen (born in 1976 into a Chinese-Taiwanese-US-American family) is a guest in January. She understands her voice as a medium of experimental music like few others. She creates spaces of absolute presence, of immediate improvised expression. In the intimate setting of Ballhof Zwei, she meets the Finnish bass Markus Suihkonen, who has been with the Staatsoper ensemble since this season. One can look forward to the many sensually perceptible answers to the question at the heart of the

                                AUDREY CHEN & PHIL MINTON (VOICES)
                                With primary focus on the interplay between the uttered sounds of the mouth and vocal chords, Minton and Chen plumb the depths of their most inherent and bodily instruments. Their improvisations are fearless, fragile, hungry, passionate, riotous, ululating and animalistic, yet are also in all respects, human. They express, pronounce and intensely articulate (in their fashion) the many nuanced shades of their individual and collaborative conditions.

                                David Birchall, Adam Fairhall and Michael Perrett meet regularly as Minimum Wage Immanence Unit to try and find the meeting point between spectralism, free improvisation and English folksong. When it goes well it sounds like a Pelt album from 1999. They’ll be joined in this endeavor tonight by a special guest, vocalist Odie Ji Ghast.

                                Coming together again for Live Music !
                                We pick up on the spirit of our Festivals from the Mystery Music Festival in 2011 to PEOPLE Festival in 2018. On Sundays this summer, we host an early evening full of music, food and togetherness! Each session curated and put together by a group of musicians, old and new friends, that take the stage together, one after another or however and with whatever they would like to share. Surprise, mystery, all about music and the experience it ignites. The Artists will not be announced. You will know once the music begins.
                                We ignite the fireplace in the yard and our kitchen, so you are taken care of from all sides if you wish. All seated, with or without table. DJ from 4pm melting into live performances at around 5pm. Anywhere from 2-4 hours of live music awaits you. Come alone, come with friends and pick the ticket of your choice.
                                We are very much looking forward to seeing all your faces again ! Your Michelbergers and the Mystery Artists from Mixtape #2 :)
                                    Our Restaurant and Winebar will serve food and drinks.

                      Saturday, June 12, 2021
                                BEAM SPLITTER + Andrea Parkins
                                BEAM SPLITTER – Audrey Chen and Henrik Munkeby Nørstebø – is a duo for amplified voice, trombone and occasional analog electronics. Utilizing the pure sounds of acoustic and closely amplified sound sources, the duo joins together two individual voices into a distinct dialog that delves beyond the borders of the corporeal elements of extended technique and sound. There is an intimacy and conflict that becomes evident as the two personas intertwine, in moments joining together seamlessly and in the next, being left with the feeling of irrevocable fracture. The two manage between these extremes with a kind of improvised grace that reveals an effort towards a common goal. It is an honest metaphor for a human relationship in process that even in the most serene moments can leave one raw and entirely exposed.
                                Andrea Parkins is a sound artist, composer, and electroacoustic performer known for her pioneering approach on her electronically processed accordion and investigation of embodiment and chance with her self-designed virtual sound-processing instruments. Described as a “sound-ist,” of “protean,” talent by critic Steve Smith, Parkinsʼ laptop electronics, amplified objects, and Fender-amped accordion create sonic fields of lush harmonics and sculpted electronic feedback, punctuated by moments of gap and rift. Parkins' works encompass multi-diffusion audio installations; electronic music pieces; electroacoustic solo and ensemble compositions; and sound for contemporary dance, experimental film and intermedia performance.Parkinsʼ recent projects include her large-scale amplified performance drawing series, developed in 2017 when she was an invited resident artist at the Rauschenberg Residency in Captiva, Florida; and her site-based performance/installation, Two Rooms – Variation 1, for 40 loudspeakers and Solo Performer which premiered in 2016 at Akousma Festival in Montreal.

                      Friday, June 11, 2021
                                "Chords for Calling" was developed by Stine Janvin in winter 2020–21 at the invitation of Deutschlandfunk Kultur and premiered as a radio concert for Art’s Birthday on January 17, 2021. It will now be performed live on June 11 in front of an audience for the first time.
                                The project is inspired by the tradition of Norwegian Lokk singing – a mixture of calling and singing with significant ornamentation and microtonal tuning – used in earlier times to call animals home from the grazing fields. In order to bridge the often-great geographical distances between caller and animals, high pitches were preferred and voices were amplified as they echoed through the valleys, mountains, and forests of the landscape. Chords for Calling is a reworking and adaptation of Karoline Bergseth’s song Kulokk.
                                Stine Janvin translates and adapts this age-old oral tradition for the big city: Chords for Calling is an ensemble piece for six performers in an outdoor setting in the city center of Berlin. In this case, the urban landscape of closely opposing building facades on Oranienstraße is used to amplify the six voices. From the daadgalerie’s windows, the ensemble calls out to neighborhood residents to join together in a communal experience after the long pandemic winter. In doing so we are reminded that, especially in difficult times, we must find ways to reaffirm our nature as social beings and strengthen community beyond our closest circles.
                                With: Stine Janvin, Audrey Chen, Elisabetta Lanfredini, Liina Magnea, Evelyn Saylor & Cansu Tanrikulu
