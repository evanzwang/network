                                                SHORT BIO
                                                Praised for her “lyricism of dramatic intensity” (San Francisco Classical Voice) and “longevity of phrasing” (Boston Musical Intelligencer), Washington state native and cellist Audrey Chen has performed around the world in venues including Carnegie Hall, Sumitomolife Izumi Hall, Melbourne Recital Center, Royal Albert Hall, and the Kennedy Center. She has concertized with the Seattle Symphony and the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra, and has been featured as a guest artist with the Jupiter Chamber Players, Argus Quartet, Parker Quartet, and Borromeo Quartet. Audrey performs actively as the cellist of the prize-winning Terra String Quartet.
                                                ​
                                                Audrey’s festival appearances include performing at Yellowbarn, Olympic Music Festival, Music@Menlo, Ravinia Steans Music Institute, Four Seasons Chamber Music, Perlman Music Program, Tanglewood Music Center, Taos Music School, and Sarasota Music Festival. She received her B.A. from Harvard University and an M.M. from the New England Conservatory, where her teachers included Laurence Lesser and Lluis Claret. Currently, she is pursuing a D.M.A. at the CUNY Graduate Center under Marcy Rosen while teaching chamber music at CUNY Hunter College. On account of her graduate studies, she was named a 2022 recipient of the prestigious Paul and Daisy Soros Fellowship for New Americans. Outside of music, Audrey enjoys watching films, cooking/baking, and making greeting cards.
