                            Our food system is very resource and emissions intensive and contributes to a broad range of environmental impacts. We have developed cradle-to-market greenhouse gas emissions estimates of supplying fresh tomatoes to 10 of the largest metropolitan areas in the United States and applied a linear optimization algorithm to determine the optimal tomato...

                            The food production and supply systems are some of the biggest contributors to climate change, and food loss from the entire food chain aggravates the problem. We developed a model to estimate the GHG emissions from the entire food cycle (production, packaging, transportation, refrigeration, and waste management), and applied it to cherries, onions...

                            Species Sensitivity Distribution (SSD) is a key metric for understanding the potential ecotoxicological impacts of chemicals. However, SSDs have been developed to estimate for only handful of chemicals due to the scarcity of experimental toxicity data. Here we present a novel approach to expand the chemical coverage of SSDs using Artificial Neural...

                            Purpose
Understanding uncertainty is essential in using life cycle assessment (LCA) to support decisions. Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) is widely used to characterize the variability in LCA results, be them life cycle inventory (LCI), category indicator results, normalized results, or weighted results. In this study, we present a new method to decom...

                            Typical applications of LCA assume that the magnitude of life-cycle impact grows proportionally to the volume of demand, while in reality the additional impact due to marginal increase in demand may differ from the average impact. In the literature, the calculation of marginal life-cycle impacts often involves the use of optimization models, where...

                            Purpose
Uncertainty analyses in life cycle assessment (LCA) literature have focused primarily on the life cycle inventory (LCI) phase, but LCA experts generally agree that the life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) phase is likely to contribute even more to the overall uncertainty of an LCA result. The magnitude of perceived uncertainties in character...

                            Most existing life-cycle release models for engineered nanomaterials (ENM) are static, ignoring the dynamics of stock and flows of ENMs. Our model, nanoRelease, estimates the annual releases of ENMs from manufacturing, use, and disposal of a product explicitly taking stock and flow dynamics into account.
