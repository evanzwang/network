                I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of California, Berkeley.
                My research in food, water and energy nexus focuses on the evaluation of alternative water sources in food production and processing and the impact of food loss using life cycle assessment tools. I am interested in working in the field of sustainability especially in
                environmental impact quantification
                for making better decisions and choices.
              During my PhD, I studied Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) with an emphasis in assessing uncertainty of LCA results and improving reliability of LCA applications. I worked on an environmental and health impact-predicting tool for new chemicals, called Chemical Life Cycle Collaborate (
                [CLiCC](https://clicc.ucsb.edu)
                ), and mainly focusing on the uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of the results. My previous research involves the uncertainty quantification of Ecoinvent data (the world largest LCA database) and the determination of probability distribution of inventory data. I am also skilled in many statistical and computational tools such as R, Matlab, Python, and Github.
                I received Ph.D. in Environmental Science and Management from
                University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB), where I earned my master’s degree. Prior to UCSB, I received a B.S. in Environmental Policy and Management from the Ohio State University.
