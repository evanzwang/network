            Math Endowment Fund takes students to Berkeley AI Hackathon finals
                        Monday, August 26, 2024
                                                              A team of undergraduate Computer Science students placed in the top eight at a recent AI Hackathon with “Skyline,” a project that uses demographic data and machine learning to simulate cities and use these patterns to optimize its transit infrastructure.
                                                              The four students – Rajan Agarwal (Software Engineering), Elijah Kurien (Software Engineering), Ishaan Dey (Software Engineering) and Joshua Yan (Computer Science) – were able to attend the hackathon, which took place from June 22 to 24 at the University of California – Berkeley, thanks to sponsorship from the Math Endowment Fund. “We had two goals,” Agarwal says: “to represent Waterloo on an international stage, and to learn more about the connections between machine learning, math and calculus.”

                The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is co-ordinated within the
