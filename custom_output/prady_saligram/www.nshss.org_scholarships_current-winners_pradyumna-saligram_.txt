                    Deira International School
                    Dubai, United Arab Emirates
                    Pradyumna 'Prady' Saligram is a college freshman studying Computer Science at Stanford University. He is passionate about ML and generative AI and hopes to pursue AI further as a track concentration within his major. He is also considering a co-term where he would receive his bachelor's and master's within five years. Apart from academics, Prady is an initiative-seeker seeking to explore the coalescence of entrepreneurship and technology at Silicon Valley. You'll catch him on the tennis courts or at the gym, as staying active is a large part of his lifestyle. To this end, he loves Stanford's huge campus, which necessitates long bike rides and walks.
