                                        Please download the node embedding file (
                                          raw_emb.pt
                                          ) and place it in the
                                        Pre-trained Model Checkpoints
                                        All model checkpoints are located in the
                                        . For RevTrack (DS variant), we provide three models each for both finetuned and non-finetuned versions. We also provide three models for each baseline (MLP, NGCF, LightGCN) in the subgraph recommendation task.
                                        Reproducing Experiments
                                      For running all the experiments in the paper, we use
                                        [wandb sweeps](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/sweeps/)
                                        , which allows us to search over hyperparameters, or run a set of experiments with different seeds or settings. We used a single V100 GPU for all experiments in the paper.
                                        For all the experiments, we provide a yaml configuration file in the
                                          configurations/sweep
                                          directory. You can run it using the following command
                                            #
                                            Initialize your sweep:
                                          wandb sweep --project
                                          <
                                          project
                                          >
                                          --entity
                                          entity
                                          path_to_yaml_file
                                            Your terminal will output a sweep ID.
                                            Run the sweep by launching the sweep agent:
                                          wandb agent
                                          sweep_id
                                            (Launch on multiple terminals to parallelize, if you want)
                                        Note that the YAML files reference our pre-trained model checkpoints in the
                                          directory. If you want to evaluate your own checkpoints, you can modify the
                                          parameters.load.values
                                          field in the YAML files.
                                        is an algorithm that identifies potential senders and receivers of each subgraph. The provided dataset is already preprocessed using
                                        , as mentioned above. We will also share the RevTrack preprocessing code soon.

                                      We have two variants of

                                        . Each experiment has a corresponding folder with sweep yaml files. The test metrics are logged as
