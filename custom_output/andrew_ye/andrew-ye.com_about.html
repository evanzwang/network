Hi! I’m Andrew, and I am a third-year undergraduate at Stanford University studying computer science and mathematics. I grew up in Seattle and Hong Kong and enjoy solving puzzles, playing piano (current favorite: Liszt), and hiking with my <a href="/assets/images/son.jpg">dog</a>. I also like to write down things of interest – or of no interest – in my <a href="/blog">blog</a>.</p>

<p>In particular, some fields I enjoy learning about include neural architectures, human-computer interaction, probability/combinatorics, metacognition, and learning theory. I am currently involved in several projects that lie at the heart of the intersections of these topics (see <a href="/publications">publications</a>), including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Founding <strong>quant[at]CWRU</strong>, a student-led research group supported by professors <a class="about-link" href="https://engineering.case.edu/about/school-directory/shuai-xu" target="_blank">Shuai Xu</a> and <a href="https://engineering.case.edu/about/school-directory/vipin-chaudhary" target="_blank">Vipin Chaudhary</a> focused on integrating current paradigms in machine learning to solve complex financial tasks.</li>
  <li>Reducing post hoc error rates in low-precision language models with Professor <a href="https://ottovonxu.github.io/" target="_blank">Zhaozhuo Xu</a>.</li>
  <li>Designing pruning and knowledge editing algorithms for convolutional and graph neural networks with Reseachers at <a href="https://d2k.rice.edu/" target="_blank">Rice AI</a> and <a href="https://imes.mit.edu/" target="_blank">MIT</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Broadly, some questions in AI that I am interested in addressing include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How can we ensure that the systems we build are faithful and secure?</li>
  <li>Models improve with size, yet they are often overparameterized and inefficient. How do we effectively balance this scale-bloat tradeoff?</li>
  <li>How do neural networks fundamentally reason, think, and <em>learn</em>?</li>
  <li>On that topic, where do we draw the line for artificial general intelligence as it grows nearer?</li>
</ul>

<p>In the past, I…</p>
<ul>
  <li>Taught data analytics and statistics at DigiPen Institute of Technology.</li>
  <li>Worked with <a class="about-link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/angelalban/" target="_blank">Angel Alban</a> to create better healthcare systems as an intern for <a class="about-link" href="https://www.zventus.com/" target="_blank">Zventus</a>.</li>
  <li>Did the first half of my undergrad education at Case Western Reserve University.</li>
</ul>
