        .
      In particular, some fields I enjoy learning about include neural architectures, human-computer interaction, probability/combinatorics, metacognition, and learning theory. I am currently involved in several projects that lie at the heart of the intersections of these topics (see
        [publications](/publications)
        ), including:
        Founding
          quant[at]CWRU
          , a student-led research group supported by professors
          [Shuai Xu](https://engineering.case.edu/about/school-directory/shuai-xu)
          and
          [Vipin Chaudhary](https://engineering.case.edu/about/school-directory/vipin-chaudhary)
          focused on integrating current paradigms in machine learning to solve complex financial tasks.
        Reducing post hoc error rates in low-precision language models with Professor
          [Zhaozhuo Xu](https://ottovonxu.github.io/)
        Designing pruning and knowledge editing algorithms for convolutional and graph neural networks with Reseachers at
          [Rice AI](https://d2k.rice.edu/)
          [MIT](https://imes.mit.edu/)
      Broadly, some questions in AI that I am interested in addressing include:
        How can we ensure that the systems we build are faithful and secure?
        Models improve with size, yet they are often overparameterized and inefficient. How do we effectively balance this scale-bloat tradeoff?
        How do neural networks fundamentally reason, think, and
          learn
          ?
        On that topic, where do we draw the line for artificial general intelligence as it grows nearer?
      In the past, I…
