          Mechatronics Design
          ME102B provides students with an opportunity to integrate mechanical and electrical systems to create “smart” mechatronics devices. Over the course, students become familiar with event-driven programming, common machine elements, and electromechanical actuators with drive electronics.
          The course culminates in an Inventor’s Open House where students demonstrate their projects. This page highlights these projects. An archive of project videos from all years (that Prof. Stuart taught the class) can be found on the class channel of

                Award winning projects from Fall 2021:
                The showcase occurred on
                  Wednesday, 12/8/2021 from 12-1:30pm at Jacobs Hall room 310
                  . Attendees were able to witness the ingenuity and skill of our amazing mechanical engineering students! The event was live and in-person.
                This semester, half of the class consisted of individual labs and assignments in order to learn specific mechatronics skills. Therefore, the project represents the second half of the semester’s work, to deepen and apply lessons in a more integrated product. This semester was also the debut of the
                  [ASME MakerGrant](https://asme.berkeley.edu/student-resources-2/asme-maker-grant/)
                  system, led by students in the ASME student group, which provided students with funding to help support their project realization.
