                    Jacob Wright has left
                      [Manchester City](/en/team/manchester-city-209)
                      for Norwich
                      [City](/en/team/manchester-city-209)
                      on a season-long loan agreement, with the Championship side having the option to make the move permanent.
                  It is the latest step in the teenager‚Äôs rising career as he makes the move to Carrow Road off the back of invaluable experiences working alongside Pep Guardiola‚Äôs first-team squad on a regular basis since last summer.
                  OneFootball Videos
                  Having been first included in City‚Äôs senior squad for the FIFA Club World Cup in Saudi Arabia back in December 2023, Wright made his senior debut for the club appearing from the substitute‚Äôs bench in the FA Cup third round win over Huddersfield the following January.
                  Later in the same season, Jacob Wright made his UEFA Champions League debut for the club as part of the last-16 victory over Copenhagen, while joining the club on their pre-season tour of the United States ahead of the ongoing season.
                  However, in the ongoing campaign, Jacob Wright has only managed two appearances for Pep Guardiola‚Äôs side despite their shortcomings in the defensive midfield position, featuring in the Carabao Cup third and fourth round ties against Watford and Tottenham respectively.
                  As Jacob Wright completes his move to East Anglian-based Championship side Norwich
                    during the ongoing transfer window, here is everything you need to know about the deal!
                  What are the terms of Jacob Wright‚Äôs move to Norwich
                    from Manchester City?
                  Jacob Wright has joined Championship side Norwich
                    on loan until the end of the season, while the Canaries have the option to make the move permanent in the summer for a ¬£5 million fee.
                  What has Jacob Wright said upon joining Norwich City?
                  Speaking to Norwich‚Äôs official club website, Jacob Wright said, ¬†‚ÄúI‚Äôm really happy to be here, happy to get everything over the line on time. I‚Äôm looking forward to getting into training tomorrow and the games will be coming thick and fast.‚Äù
                  What have Norwich
                    said about the completed deal?
                  Norwich City‚Äôs sporting director Ben Knapper said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to extend a very warm welcome to Jacob and his family. He is an extremely talented young player who we have been aware of and tracked for quite some time.
                  ‚ÄúWe believe that his attributes and qualities, particularly in possession, are well suited to our playing style and we‚Äôre excited to see what he can bring to our group. He is another fantastic addition that we are really looking forward to working with.‚Äù
