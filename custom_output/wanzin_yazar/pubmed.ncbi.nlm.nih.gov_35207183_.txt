          Sub-optimal sensitivity and specificity in current allograft monitoring methodologies underscore the need for more accurate and reflexive immunosurveillance to uncover the flux in alloimmunity between allograft health and the onset and progression of rejection. QSant-a urine based multi-analyte diagnostic test-was developed to profile renal transplant health and prognosticate injury, risk of evolution, and resolution of acute rejection. Q-Score-the composite score, across measurements of DNA, protein and metabolic biomarkers in the QSant assay-enables this risk prognostication. The domain of immune quiescence-below a Q-Score threshold of 32-is well established, based on published AUC of 98% for QSant. However, the trajectory of rejection is variable, given that causality is multi-factorial. Injury and subtypes of rejection are captured by the progression of Q-Score. This publication explores the clinical utility of QSant across the alloimmunity gradient of 32-100 for the early diagnosis of allograft injury and rejection.

              Early rejection is a histologically patchy process [4]. Renal allograft biopsies can return a false negative or true positive result based on the region of tissue sampling. The top
                cube
                samples tissue from a region of the kidney where rejection is not present and would result in a false negative. The bottom
                samples tissue from a region of the kidney manifesting rejection and would result in a true positive. Given the gold standard stature of biopsy, it would most definitely impact patient care. This is the inherent fallibility of the renal biopsy as the standard for rejection diagnosis.

                left
                ) Q-Score < 32 reflects a stable immune quiescent allograft status. Q-Scores in the 32–55 range (
                middle
                ), as demonstrated here, have the capacity to detect early, sub-clinical, or borderline rejection, where the gold-standard biopsy can often miss histological signs of rejection depending on where the biopsy tissue sample was taken from. This is the alloimmune injury domain. Q-Scores > 55 (
                right
                ) reflect a more mature or higher-grade acute rejection with histological and molecular alloimmune instability.
