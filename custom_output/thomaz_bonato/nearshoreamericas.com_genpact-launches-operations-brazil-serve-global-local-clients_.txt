              Genpact Launches Operations in Brazil; Will Serve Global, Local Clients
                  August 1, 2011
                  [Add comment](https://nearshoreamericas.com/genpact-launches-operations-brazil-serve-global-local-clients/#respond)
                NEW YORK  – Genpact Limited, a global leader in business process and technology management, today announced the opening of operations in Brazil, its first location in South America.
                Located in São Paulo, Genpact is now providing services for Astra Zeneca, with plans to serve additional global corporations for their Brazilian businesses as well as establish business operations for the burgeoning Brazil-to-Brazil market.
              Genpact has begun providing finance and accounting (F&A) services to Astra Zeneca from this center and is also providing IT services to a financial services client. Genpact is aggressively training and recruiting for additional employees so that it can continue to grow its broad portfolio of business process management services from this location. In line with its strategy in all global locations where it operates, Genpact will rely on local leadership hires to lead its growth and staff client projects, thus creating jobs in the surrounding community.
              In conjunction with the inauguration of the center this week, Thomaz Bonato, CFO, Astra Zeneca Brazil said, “We are pleased to work closely with Genpact to get this center established in São Paulo and running seamlessly and are confident that they will continue to provide best-in-class F&A services for Astra Zeneca along with many other companies. We know that Genpact shares our vision of the business growth potential here in Brazil, so this will be an exciting journey for both companies.”
              “Genpact’s expansion into Brazil is in line with our growth strategy to bring our global business practices and expertise to rapidly growing emerging economies to serve global corporations expanding there as well as local growth companies,” said Tiger Tyagarajan, president and CEO, Genpact. “We are thrilled to partner with our key client Astra Zeneca in establishing our center in São Paulo and we look forward to growing our Brazil business with them and many other clients. We will immediately be able to bring our global knowledge of managing end-to-end business processes to drive better outcomes for our clients.”
