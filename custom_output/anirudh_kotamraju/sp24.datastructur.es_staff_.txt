              Hi All! I’m Justin (he/him), one of the co-instructors for 61B and 61C this semester. As an undergraduate, I did a double math/CS major, and completed a fifth-year masters in a parallel computing project (all at Berkeley). I additionally worked as a TA for nine semesters, with a focus on exam writing. Outside of work, I spend most of my time playing Celeste (9D is brutal) and solving/writing puzzles as part of BMT and teammate. Part 1 of 2: Literal wariness snacks overpays, but fries alert scams. Foaming clams?

              Hello, I’m a second-year lecturer in EECS (so don’t call me Professor please). I did my undergrad at Berkeley, where I TA’d for a few classes (including CS 61C, CS 161, and CS 188 once). Then I did a masters’ at Berkeley, where I studied computer science education with Nicholas Weaver and Dan Garcia. This is my second time teaching CS 61B as co-instructor, so any feedback/advice/complaints are appreciated!

When I’m not debugging something you can find me going on walks around Berkeley or the Fire Trails.
