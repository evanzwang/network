                    NBC10 obtained surveillance video of a hit-and-run crash in Philadelphia‚Äôs Port Richmond neighborhood that left a 40-year-old man in critical condition. Police are currently searching for four teenagers in connection to the crash.
                    Video shows one of the teens run off on foot while at least three other teens enter a white SUV.
                    One of the parked cars that got hit belonged to neighbor Eric Flemming.
                    "It sounded like a bomb went off. Came downstairs, saw the aftermath," Flemming said.
                    The video shows Flemming running outside and yelling the license plate number of the SUV before it drives away from the scene.
                    ‚ÄúFJW-5082,‚Äù Flemming says repeatedly in the video.

                    Mounds of metal and debris scattered nearly a half block down the street after the crash.
                    "Luckily, nobody was in any of the parked cars," Flemming said.
                    According to employees who worked with the victim, he worked at the AutoZone at 3337 Aramingo Avenue. They said he works in the hub department which means he delivers parts from one store to another and that is what he was doing at the time of the crash.
