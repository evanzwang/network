                    A petition calling for a Milwaukee meteorologist to be reinstated at her job after she was reportedly fired for criticizing
                      on social media has gathered over 40,000 signatures.
                    Last week, meteorologist Sam Kuffel was let go from her position at CBS-affiliated WDJT-TV. Her exit came after she posted on a private social media account about Musk's recent straight-arm gesture that many have said
                      [looked like a Nazi salute](https://www.newsweek.com/elon-musk-salute-inauguration-speech-donald-trump-2017960)
                      .
                    The
                      Milwaukee Journal Sentinel
                      reported a spokesperson for Weigel Broadcasting Co., which owns WDJT-TV, confirmed Kuffel was no longer at the station but did not give more details.
                      Newsweek
                      contacted WDJT-TV via online form on Friday for comment and sent a direct message to Kuffel via social media. The press email for Musk's platform X (formerly
                      ) was also contacted.
                    Why It Matters
                    Musk was accused of making a Nazi salute during President
                      's inauguration on January 20. The

                      on X.
                    "Frankly, they need better dirty tricks," Musk wrote. "The 'everyone is Hitler' attack is sooo tired."

                    What To Know
                    An email was sent to Kuffel's WDJT-TV colleagues on January 22, notifying them that the weather forecaster had left the station, the
                      reported.The newspaper said Kuffel's biography and picture had also been removed from the WDJT-TV (Channel 58) website.
                    Her departure followed two posts on her personal
                      account about Musk's gesture at Trump's inauguration. In one post, as described by the
                      Journal Sentinel
                      , Kuffel reportedly shared a picture of Musk at the podium, saying: "Dude Nazi saluted twice. TWICE. During the inauguration."
                    She added, "You f*** with this and this man, I don't f*** with you. Full stop." Kuffel also reportedly posted an anti-Nazi meme taken from the television show
                      It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia
                      which features a character is saying, "Screw that old b****. He's a Nazi."
                    Kuffel's Instagram account has since been set to private.
                    Petition For Kuffel
                    After news spread that Kuffel was no longer at the station, a

                      was started that calls on WDJT-TV to give Kuffel her job back. The petition has collected over 41,000 signatures as of press time.
                    "It should go without saying that individuals should NOT be punished for speaking out against Nazis or even simply expressing opposition to billionaires on their private social media accounts," the petition reads.
                    What People Are Saying
                      The Anti-Defamation League, on X, posted:
                      "It seems that @elonmusk made an awkward gesture in a moment of enthusiasm, not a Nazi salute, but again, we appreciate that people are on edge."
                      Elon Musk wrote on X:
                      in response to critics: "Frankly, they need better dirty tricks. The 'everyone is Hitler' attack is sooo tired."
                      What Happens Next
                    Kuffel, who listed 2019 as her start date at WDJT-TV on LinkedIn, has not publicly commented.
                    The MoveOn petition states its goal is to collect 45,000 signatures.
