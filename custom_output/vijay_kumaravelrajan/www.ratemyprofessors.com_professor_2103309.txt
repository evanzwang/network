                          Really responsible, care for students, answer all the questions and give feedback toward everything of the course. It was so moving that Prof. Kumar recorded lecture videos and held several online OH in COVID-19 term. The course goes much more tough in the last several weeks. 3 midterms and 1 final is heavy but a nice setting for students to learn.

                          Lectures are good and cover most of the relevant material but the Prof gives a lot of homework to students. So you gotta be up-to-date with the material. Be prepared for difficult tests.

                              Rather not say
                          He is good. Challenges concepts taught in the classroom. Test was difficult.
