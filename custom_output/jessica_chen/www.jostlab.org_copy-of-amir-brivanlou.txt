                                      ​About Jessica
                                  Jessica grew up in Rhode Island and attended Northeastern University for her undergraduate degree, majoring in Bioengineering with minors in Math and Art. Through Northeastern, she completed co-op experiences in software quality assurance at a medical device company and in upstream process development at a biotech company, the latter of which sparked an interest in cell culture. Her final co-op was spent with Boston Children's Hospital in Judy Lieberman's immunology lab, where she worked on a project to investigate substrates of inflammatory enzyme Caspase-4.Her growing interest and passion for research led her to the research assistant position here in the Jost lab, where she is very excited to delve into the world of microbiology, learn about the gut microbiome, and gain new technical skills.
                                  Outside of the lab, Jessica can be found reading, rock climbing (and sometimes falling), exploring Boston with friends, and occasionally attempting to learn a new song on the keyboard.
