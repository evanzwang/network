              Dr. Nicole Nova
              is a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the
                High Meadows Environmental Institute at Princeton University
              . Dr. Nova received her PhD in Biology (Ecology and Evolution) from Stanford University in 2022. While at Stanford, she earned an MS in Statistics in 2020 and became a
                Stanford Data Science Scholar
              and a Predoctoral Fellow at the
                Center for Computational, Evolutionary and Human Genomics
              . Dr. Nova is a member of the
                Program for Disease Ecology, Health and the Environment
              and the
                Program for Conservation Genomics
              .
              [Karolinska Institutet](http://ki.se/en/startpage)
              in Sweden. She also conducted biomedical research, and completed a
              [Master's thesis](Files/master.pdf)
              on the pathophysiology of chronic pain in rheumatoid arthritis. This was conducted in the
              [Molecular Pain Lab](http://ki.se/en/fyfa/molecular-pain-research)
              in collaboration with the Department of Physiology and Pharmacology and the Department of Oral Physiology at
          div class="featured-text-white text-justify text-lg-just"
          She also studied abroad for a semester at
            [Queen Mary University of London](http://www.qmul.ac.uk/)
            as an
            [EU Erasmus Mundus](http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/erasmus_mundus/)
            scholar, and completed a clinical summer internship at the Department of Head and Neck Surgery,
            [Medical University of Vienna](http://www.meduniwien.ac.at/homepage/1/homepage/)
            , Austria. She worked on several head and neck cancer cases and became interested in the development of cancer at the cell population level. That spark of interest led her to study ecology and evolutionary biology, and its useful applications in medicine, public health, and eventually planetary health and conservation.

            [Michor Lab](http://michorlab.dfci.harvard.edu/)
            in the Department of Data Science at the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health). She worked on mathematical modeling of cancer development using theories from evolutionary dynamics and population genetics.
            [Koelle Research Group](https://scholarblogs.emory.edu/koellelab/group-members/)
            in the Department of Biology at Duke University. There she studied eco-evolutionary dynamics of infectious diseases. She formulated a mathematical model that captured the development of broadly neutralizing antibodies (BnAbs) in chronic HIV-infections. This allowed her to study the within-host co-evolution between BnAbs and HIV, which could potentially provide useful insights for developing effective HIV vaccines.

            Research Projects
            The overall research topic concerns conservation science and ecological/ evolutionary mechanisms for diseases in humans, domestic animals, and wildlife.  Some of the ongoing research projects are described below. Other published research can be found under

                Distemper in Canid Wildlife
                This is a phylogenetic and phylodynamic study of a multi-host pathogen, called canine distemper virus. It has caused several outbreaks in the Yellowstone wolf population. It has also been reported in Arctic foxes in Alaska, but its disease dynamics in North American carnivores remains unknown. This study investigates the relatedness of canine distemper virus strains across different carnivore species in Yellowstone and Alaska to determine disease dynamics, transmission pathways, and potential reservoir host species. Because of its high mortality and rapid transmission, the virus poses a major threat to wild carnivores.
      Project Two Row
                Parasite-Sharing Across Taxa
                This is a project that determines when ecological factors (i.e., geography, host behavior, host life history, etc.) become more important for predicting parasite sharing between various host species than their phylogenetic relatedness (evolutionary factor). This is useful for predicting the most likely source of new emerging diseases threatening human health and the survival of endangered species.

              is a summer research program for high school students at
              [Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)](http://www.mit.edu/)
              and co-sponsored by the
              [Center for Excellence in Education (CEE)](http://cee.org/)
              . Dr. Nova attended RSI as a student in 2007 and she worked with Prof. Jeremy Wolfe in the
              [Visual Attention Lab](http://search.bwh.harvard.edu/new/)
              in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at

              [Brigham and Women's Hospital](http://www.brighamandwomens.org/)
              . She was investigating whether a simple search task (i.e., looking for a green line among red lines) was correlated with the search for objects in the real world, in particular, the search for weapons in airport security (X-ray images of luggage). The work was later published in the
              . As an RSI alum, Dr. Nova has been involved with the RSI program for several years and served as the Director of RSI in 2016, and a research mentor in 2020.  For more information, see the
