            ‘Abbott Elementary’ actor Matthew Law on Seattle upbringing, ‘True Story’
              Dec. 9, 2024 at 6:00 am

                      Gregory Wakeman
                  Special to The Seattle Times
              When Matthew Law joined “Abbott Elementary,” it was literally a dream come true.
              The actor and filmmaker, who was born in Yakima and raised in Seattle, calls the sitcom about a group of Philadelphia teachers trying to educate their students a “generationally great show,” adding, “I genuinely think it’s one of the best shows ever made. I’m in love with it.”
              So when Law was cast in the
                [recurring role](https://deadline.com/2024/10/abbott-elementary-matthew-law-cast-season-4-1236156556/)
                of O’Shon, the school district’s new IT representative who catches the eye of principal Ava Coleman (Janelle James), he was immediately excited — and a little intimidated.

              “It was intimidating because I didn’t want to mess it up,” Law says over the phone. “I think what (series creator and star) Quinta Brunson and the rest of the cast and crew have created is a show that’s joyful and truthful.”
              Law didn’t just want to excel on “Abbott Elementary” because it’s one of the most beloved and popular sitcoms on television. He put extra pressure on himself because he studied at Temple University, and his time in Philadelphia shaped who he is. At the same time, the public schools he attended in Seattle are where he first fell in love with movies.
              “I attended Greenwood Elementary, Whitman Middle, then Ballard High. … I had teachers who introduced me to Hitchcock in middle school.”

              Law and his friends would hang around people who were into film, which then sparked his fascination with editing and cinematography, the latter of which he studied at Temple. It was only after he completed his studies that Law first started performing. While he’d always been interested in it, as someone who wanted to write, direct, edit, produce and photograph, he thought adding another string to his bow would be excessive. But the urge never went away.
              “I always had that desire. But I think it was easier for me to hide in production. Acting called for me to be vulnerable in a way that I wasn’t ready for.”
              When Law arrived in Los Angeles, he finally decided to take the plunge and attend acting classes. As he learned more about the craft and training, he started to feel “a little whisper of intuition” that told him acting was really part of his purpose. Law was clearly right to follow his instincts: Over the past few years, he’s appeared in episodes of “Home Economics,” “NCIS: Los Angeles” and the Star Wars series “Ahsoka,” as well as the music video for Jennifer Lopez’s “Can’t Get Enough,” and had a recurring role in all five seasons of Tyler Perry’s political drama “The Oval.”

              Law has also been hard at work behind the camera. He’s written and directed five short films for his “True Story” series, which he describes as noir therapy drama. Each film follows a character struggling with their mental health and trying to find guidance from a therapist and/or their friends. “True Story: God Tells Bad Jokes” won the award for best short narrative at the 2023 Pan African Film & Arts Festival, which qualified it for the Academy Awards. At the end of 2023, Law held the multimedia event “True: An Immersive Cinematic Experience” in Los Angeles, which saw the short films incorporated into a play with live music. It sold out all five shows and more than 2,000 people attended. Law already has ambitions to take it to New York and Seattle for similar events.

              Law’s small-screen exploits are expanding, too. Not only is he appearing in “Abbott Elementary,” but Law can be seen in the second season of “Based on a True Story.” All eight episodes of the dark comedy thriller, which stars Kaley Cuoco and Chris Messina as a couple obsessed with true crime, are available on Peacock. As a fan of both Cuoco and Messina’s work, Law was again a little nervous when he arrived on set to portray the character of Nick. But, much like his time on “Abbot Elementary,” he was quickly blown away by how “fun and collaborative” the experience was.
              “There’s a real spirit of collaboration on both of these shows. But you’re also very aware of the creative vision that they’re trying to achieve. On both of the shows, everyone involved — from the PAs to the writers and directors — they’re all so invested. That’s so invigorating to see. These are two shows that are being run right. You can see that on screen, too.”
              But while Law is hopeful he’ll get to return in further episodes of “Abbott Elementary,” and is hard at work making sure “True Story” is seen by people across the country, he’s hoping this is just the start of his creative endeavors. Law’s ambition is always to just “grow and deepen as an artist,” whether it’s acting, directing, producing or writing, and to tell new stories.
              “Hopefully, one day soon, I can come back to Seattle and Yakima and give people that chance. I just want to give people the chance to share their stories. Because there are so many that haven’t been seen or heard before.”

                  The first eight episodes of Season 4 are streaming on Hulu. New episodes resume Jan. 8 on ABC.
