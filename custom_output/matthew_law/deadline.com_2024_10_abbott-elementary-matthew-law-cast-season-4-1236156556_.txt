                Deadline has a teaser of the episode above and first look-photos of Law as O’Shon below. Tonight, Janine (Quinta Brunson) gets a budget for class pets, but Melissa (Lisa Ann Walter) resists taking on the added work and responsibility for her room’s guinea pig. An IT rep from the school district arrives to set up new computers.

                These are likely the new computers promised to the Abbott teachers by the attorney for that fancy new golf course that’s being built nearby. In the Season 4 premiere, the teachers were quite irritated by the construction traffic, as well as the impending gentrification from the addition to the neighborhood. But, their tunes quickly changed when that sweet-talking lawyer showed up with gift cards and vows for new supplies.
                      Barbara (Sheryl Le Ralph) looks tickled by O’Shon (Matthew Law), the school’s IT rep, who debuts tonight
                      Disney/Gilles Mingasson
                  takes place in a predominantly Black Philadelphia public school. Brunson plays Janine Teagues, an optimistic second-grade teacher who makes it her mission to help enrich her students’ lives while also managing her own personal life.
                  stars Emmy Award winner Quinta Brunson as Janine Teagues, Tyler James Williams as Gregory Eddie, Janelle James as Ava Coleman, Chris Perfetti as Jacob Hill, Lisa Ann Walter as Melissa Schemmenti, William Stanford Davis as Mr. Johnson and Emmy Award winner Sheryl Lee Ralph as Barbara Howard.
                Brunson created the series and serves as executive producer alongside Justin Halpern and Patrick Schumacker of Delicious Non-Sequitur Productions, Randall Einhorn and Brian Rubenstein. The series is produced by Warner Bros. Television and 20th Television, a part of Disney Television Studios.
                Hailing from Seattle now based in LA, Law is an actor, writer, director and activist. His recent credits include
                  for Disney+ and the upcoming season of
                  Based on a True Story
                  for Peacock. He wrote and directed an immersive stage show about Black men’s mental health titled
                  True
                  that recently had its sixth sold-out show in LA after the film qualified for Oscar consideration. He is repped by YMU Group and Buchwald.
