                          Eric Mao | Season 13 MasterChef Australia Contestant
                        < Regional Chinese + Pan Asian Cuisine
                        Eric Mao is a medical student, food enthusiast and Season 13 Contestant on MasterChef Australia. Food has always been the medium through which Eric has connected with his heritage and communicated his love.
                        ​Eric’s fondest food memory is of a banquet dinner during one of the first times he had visited Wuxi 无锡 - his parents' hometown. A 2 hour drive from Shanghai, this small city flanked by plum flowers and lotus lakes ultimately birthed his zeal for Chinese cuisine. It was the evening of Lunar New Year festivities and Eric was sat at a grand round table, lavishly presented with an exquisite array of Chinese delicacies including bright orange Autumn mitten crabs, wine-marinated goose, fresh plucked bamboo shoots, pork and crab tomalley dumplings, steamed carp from Lake Tai, stuffed lotus roots harvested from a nearby lily pond, osmanthus blossoms, simmered taro balls and sweet deep fried river eels. These were flavours and ingredients Eric had never encountered before and he was met with a veritable explosion of new and exciting ideas of what food could be.
                        ​Eric is excited to present, through recipes, photos and stories, this picture of Chinese culture and gastronomy; one that is vivid, diverse and authentic, all whilst embracing the terroir of the wonderful Australian country.
                        You can follow along Eric’s food journey via his
                            website
