                At the tender age of 21, Eric Mao is already a veteran of the MasterChef kitchen. He auditioned for Junior MasterChef Australia some ten years ago at 10 years of age, and although he didn’t quite make it into the competition, the MasterChef magic stuck with him.
                One of two children born to his immigrant Chinese parents, Eric is inspired to share his food philosophy and passion for regional Chinese cuisine with Australia. With roots in Wuxi in Eastern China, Eric and his family have travelled back to their homeland on numerous occasions.
                Eric cites a Lunar New Year Huaiyang banquet in 2018 as having blown his mind. He found it truly revolutionary and it heavily influenced his connection to food.
                A third-year medical student at the University of NSW, Eric is out to prove there is more to him than just his academic side. He missed his final clinical exam to audition for the judges and made the gut-wrenching decision to defer his studies, but now clutching an elusive MasterChef Australia apron, it’s a decision he’s very glad he made.
                Self-taught, Eric draws inspiration from all corners, looking to English writer Fuschia Dunlop, chefs Wang Gang and Massimo Bottura, as well as his family’s love of eating. The inimitable Poh Ling Yeow even inspired his Junior MasterChef Australia audition dish a decade ago.
                Eric says it’s his understanding of flavour combinations, fundamental food chemistry, techniques, history and culture that will elevate his chances in the competition. Chinese and Japanese cuisines will be safe harbour and he knows he’ll need to be organised to succeed.
                Always thinking about his next meal, Eric’s dream is to have a pop-up restaurant that brings regional Chinese cuisine into a modern Australian setting. Endeavouring to make both himself and his parents proud, Eric will dedicate the trophy to them if he wins.
                  He used to auditoned for Junior MasterChef Australia when he was 10 but he didn't make it to the show.
                  At 21, he is the youngest man of the season.
