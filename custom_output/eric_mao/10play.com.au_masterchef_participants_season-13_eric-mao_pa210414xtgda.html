He auditioned for Junior MasterChef Australia some ten years ago at 10 years of age, and although he didn’t quite make it into the competition, the MasterChef magic stuck with him.\r\n\r\nOne of two children born to his immigrant Chinese parents, Eric is inspired to share his food philosophy and passion for regional Chinese cuisine with Australia. With roots in Wuxi in Eastern China, Eric and his family have travelled back to their homeland on numerous occasions.\r\n\r\nEric cites a Lunar New Year Huaiyang banquet in 2018 as having blown his mind. He found it truly revolutionary and it heavily influenced his connection to food.\r\n\r\nA third-year medical student at the University of NSW, Eric is out to prove there is more to him than just his academic side. He missed his final clinical exam to audition for the judges and made the gut-wrenching decision to defer his studies, but now clutching an elusive MasterChef Australia apron, it’s a decision he’s very glad he made.\r\n\r\nSelf-taught, Eric draws inspiration from all corners, looking to English writer Fuschia Dunlop, chefs Wang Gang and Massimo Bottura, as well as his family’s love of eating. The inimitable Poh Ling Yeow even inspired his Junior MasterChef Australia audition dish a decade ago.\r\n\r\nEric says it’s his understanding of flavour combinations, fundamental food chemistry, techniques, history and culture that will elevate his chances in the competition. Chinese and Japanese cuisines will be safe harbour and he knows he’ll need to be organised to succeed.\r\n\r\nAlways thinking about his next meal, Eric’s dream is to have a pop-up restaurant that brings regional Chinese cuisine into a modern Australian setting. Endeavouring to make both himself and his parents proud, Eric will dedicate the trophy to them if he wins."}]}

show-participants__participant__details__content"><h3>Eric Mao</h3><div class="show__text"><h2>NSW, 21, Medical Student</h2><p>At the tender age of 21, Eric Mao is already a veteran of the MasterChef kitchen. He auditioned for Junior MasterChef Australia some ten years ago at 10 years of age, and although he didn’t quite make it into the competition, the MasterChef magic stuck with him.</p><p>One of two children born to his immigrant Chinese parents, Eric is inspired to share his food philosophy and passion for regional Chinese cuisine with Australia. With roots in Wuxi in Eastern China, Eric and his family have travelled back to their homeland on numerous occasions.</p><p>Eric cites a Lunar New Year Huaiyang banquet in 2018 as having blown his mind. He found it truly revolutionary and it heavily influenced his connection to food.</p><p>A third-year medical student at the University of NSW, Eric is out to prove there is more to him than just his academic side. He missed his final clinical exam to audition for the judges and made the gut-wrenching decision to defer his studies, but now clutching an elusive MasterChef Australia apron, it’s a decision he’s very glad he made.</p><p>Self-taught, Eric draws inspiration from all corners, looking to English writer Fuschia Dunlop, chefs Wang Gang and Massimo Bottura, as well as his family’s love of eating. The inimitable Poh Ling Yeow even inspired his Junior MasterChef Australia audition dish a decade ago.</p><p>Eric says it’s his understanding of flavour combinations, fundamental food chemistry, techniques, history and culture that will elevate his chances in the competition. Chinese and Japanese cuisines will be safe harbour and he knows he’ll need to be organised to succeed.</p><p>Always thinking about his next meal, Eric’s dream is to have a pop-up restaurant that brings regional Chinese cuisine into a modern Australian setting. Endeavouring to make both himself and his parents proud, Eric will dedicate the trophy to them if he wins.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="content content--feed content--undefined

29,\u0026nbsp;Pharmacist\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eBorn in New Delhi, Depinder Chhibber moved to Newcastle at the age of 11. Now based in Sydney, she still considers herself a Novocastrian, but her heart and soul remains in India.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHighly influenced by the women in her family, Depinder grew up watching her grandmother, mum and aunties cook, fascinating and inspiring her to cook from a very young age. This involvement has nurtured her style of cooking, learning many traditional recipes from her mother and her passion to cook from her father.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHer biggest supporter is her husband Gurkirat, who she married in 2018. Together they’ve had the opportunity to travel Australia and the world, bonding over a good meal and new scenery, with dining experiences often dictating destinations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHaving followed in her father’s footsteps to become a pharmacist and currently studying for her Masters, Depinder enjoys her career. However, cooking is a passion that she can’t ignore, with much of her free time spent reading recipes and daydreaming about cooking experiments.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDepinder is inspired by Indian and South East Asian flavours. As a self-taught baker, she adores cooking pastry and desserts.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCounting Gordon Ramsay, Donna Hay, Kirsten Tibballs, Kunal Kapur and Gaggan Anand among her kitchen idols, it’s clear Depinder has taken inspiration from each of them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA keen traveller in pre-COVID times, Depinder is always up for a holiday. Most recently she visited Nepal and completed the Everest Base Camp trek, a dream come true for her.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe ability to adapt, move fast and to take on board constructive criticism will stand her in good stead during her MasterChef Australia journey, as will her ability to multitask.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis unflappable cook hopes her time in the MasterChef

When the family moved back to Berlin for four years when Maja was two, the toddler was often called on to help her oma (grandmother) in the kitchen, leading to some of her fondest food memories. It was rare for her oma to let anyone into the kitchen but Maja somehow managed to sneak a spot.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMaja loves cooking for others and showing her care for people through the food she creates.

His barrister father taught him to fish and BBQ, and Tom still loves fishing and cooking what he catches.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith an appreciation for all food cultures, Tom loves learning about different cuisines and working to accurately represent them. Tom has a strong interest in Indian food, inspired by his grandmother who came to Australia from India.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHis biggest passion in the kitchen is his love of intricate, technical and delicious desserts. After the competition, Tom would love to have his own high-end café or restaurant and build a reputation as a renowned pastry chef.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlthough Tom lives on his own, he cooks every day and often invites friends and family over to try out new recipes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eObsessed with both playing and watching tennis, Tom also enjoys kayaking and running. He loves to travel and in pre-COVID times went beyond the Arctic Circle in northern Norway where he hiked solo and spent time living in Austria.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLooking to Shannon Bennett, Kirsten Tibballs and Yotam Ottolenghi as his kitchen heroes, Tom’s calmness, ambition, humour and work ethic will be relied upon in the pressure cooker environment of the MasterChef
