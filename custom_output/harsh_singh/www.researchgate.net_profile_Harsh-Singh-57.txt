                            The sharing of patient information on an open network has drawn attention to the healthcare system. Security is the primary issue while sharing documents online. Thus, a dual watermarking technique has been developed to improve the security of shared data. The classical watermarking schemes are resilient to many attacks. Protecting the authenticity...

                            A heart stroke, also known as a myocardial infarction or heart attack, is a critical medical condition that arises when there is an obstruction in the coronary arteries that provide blood to the heart muscles. This blockage results in a diminished flow of blood and oxygen to a specific area of the heart. This abrupt interruption initiates a gradual...

                            Medical images are more typical than any other ordinary images, since it stores patient’s information for diagnosis purpose. Such images need more security and confidentiality as total diagnosis depends on it. In telemedicine applications, transmission of medical image via open channel, demands strong security and copyright protection. In our propo...
