            Garaydia ALC > ZJK/Visc > HL5 => Apolonia ZLC (depending on weight)
              Basically thick hinoki vs koto vs innerforce limba blade.

              I'm no expert on blades by any means,
              But I have Viscaria and had HL5. Viscaria just felt like it had a higher pitch and larger rebound effect when hitting the ball. Probably because of the harder wood?
              I think the hinoki has a higher rebound effect because the blade is over 7mm, not so much to do with the wood (in my opinion). If you hypothetically but a hinoki layer instead of koto on Viscaria, I believe it would be slower!
            06/26/2017 at 1:10pm
            By higher pitch do you mean more sweet spot ? ( I didn't understand the definition )

            I have a zjk blade with 2 tenergy 80 but I didn't notice so much of this catapult effect, maybe a little when the rubbers where brand new

            I played with Spirit, Viscaria, Timo Boll ALC, Zhang Jike ALC and Zhang Jike SZLC. The most catapult effect (and generate the more spin) has definitely Zhang Jike SZLC (which has the most speed and control).

            Except the Zjk Szlc which else has the most catapult from higher to lower
            06/27/2017 at 3:56am
            Except the Zjk SZLC in my opinion Timo Boll ALC has the most catapult effect.
            06/27/2017 at 5:22am
            So the most catapult comes from the most hard wood outer surface ? Heard that the boll alc has the hardest feeling of all Butterfly alc blades of Viscaria family

            Hard outer to soft core will have more catapult than soft outer to hard core. Also bigger heads have more but depend also on the plies. Viscaria has more catapult than TBS and TB ALC.

            I'm pretty sure the long 5 will have the most rebound.
              Hurricane long 5 has slightly larger head and is extremely head heavy
              timo boll spirit is also head heavy i hear

            I think Butterfly found a sweet spot in blade construction in the Viscaria, and have been working around it in various ways ever since.  Tweak a little on the thickness here or there and give it a new name.  It has been discussed on the forum a number of time the differences between the various ALC offerings, and most seem to agree that there is often more variation in a group of Viscaria blades than there is differences between the different ALC blades.  For instance a 85 gm Viscaria doesn't play like a 95 gm Viscaria.
              ZLC seems to be a new variation to address the new balls we have had forced on us, whether it is a real improvement depends on exactly what you are looking for in a blade.
              For what you are asking for, I think a Viscaria would be a good choice.  Or something similar

            I tried the following recently: Viscaria, Zhang Jike ALC, Boll ALC, Innerforce Layer ZLC. All of them had a T05 or T05FX on. In addition, there was another Viscaria and another Timo Boll ALC from another player with MXP on.

            Hey guys that's the word I was looking for : SPRINGY BLADE

            It is very hard to compare blades over the internet...the best you can do is get information on what others prefer.  What we can't tell you is whether a ALC or ZLC will feel/perform better for you.
              The best you are going to get from reading about the differences is the ability to make a somewhat more informed decision before you buy.  Like Hans says some of the better players in our area have changed to the ZLC, and seem quite happy with them.  Others have stuck with the ALC blades.  I don't think either choice has had a major impact on their playing level or on their ability to produce quality shots.  Most chose their blade with the help of a local coach who could guide them in the process and recommend something suitable for their play style.
              The touch shots like serve and return are key.
              Other options if possible might be for you to attend a tournament where there is an equipment vendor, or plan a stop while vacationing where the is a TT store.  The blades you are considering are a considerable investment, any possibility that allows you to see or test them before buying would greatly improve your chance of getting something you'll be happy with.

            Thanks man
            06/29/2017 at 11:38am
            I can't agree with Hans comments. I own both a Boll ALC as well as a Apolonia ZLC (which is very similar to the IF ZLC) and I've owned a Mizutani SZLC. The SZLC was more direct in my opinion. Besides on super hard loops, the Apo ZLC has a less pronounced throw than the ALC blades in my opinion. When you really give it the beans, the Apo will produce more throw because of the composition but by and large I would describe the Boll ALC as overall higher throw.

            I like the Viscaria the best (have used it for ten years, I own too many of them).  I think it optimizes pretty much every variable (some of which are trade-offs).  The handle could be just a little larger for me but grip wrap solves the problem completely.  It is springy enough.  Fast enough.  Control enough.  Soft enough.  Balanced enough.  It is like driving a BMW 3 series.

            Garaydia with ZLC is basically an Amultart with a different handle.  I like both blades.

              Isn't that a bit too fast with tensors / T05? What rubbers did you try with it? Does it work well with H3 Neo (if you have used it with the blade)?
