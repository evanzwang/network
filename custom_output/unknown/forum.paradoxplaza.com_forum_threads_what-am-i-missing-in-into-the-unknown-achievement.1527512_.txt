                                        Just a tad confused about what to do to get the achievement. I am playing a civilisation with the correct Origin and all, and have sent both individual manned science ships out into the unknown ten times, and even tried sending ten at once into an area where I haven't been earlier. And no matter what, I don't get the achievement. What am I doing wrong, or is the achievement bugged?

                                        Aha... is it all in one go or can you do it one by one? Very unclear what they mean. Thanks for the info so far.
