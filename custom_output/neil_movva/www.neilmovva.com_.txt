            Over the last decade, consumer electronics became
              excellent
              at handling electric power - converting it, moving it, storing it. Mobile computers, electric vehicles, and micro-scale solar installations all demanded these improvements, so the industry delivered. Let's investigate some of the core advances here, and try bringing them to hobbyist applications.

            Smartfet is a small, self-contained module designed to abstract away the complexity of high-power switching. It's designed as a simple answer to the question, “how can I modulate power to this beefy load?”

            Cricket is a hobbyist-grade solution for 360º planar rangefinding and mapping. Intended to be a rudimentary imitation of LiDAR, we trade the precision optoelectronics for hardware that's dirt-cheap and readily accessible.
