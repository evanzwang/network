                  – Caltech Men's Swim & Dive wrapped up the 2025 SCIAC Championships this past Saturday. The men finished with a respectable fourth-place finish and 440 points over the four-day meet, nearly identical to their performance at the conference championships last season. The men were able to pursue greatness and overcome the adversity of not being able to train for serious lapses of time due to the Eaton fire.

                  (Ringwood, U.K. / Ringwood School) finished first in the 100-yard freestyle consolation final with a time of 45.78 seconds! Small was able to edge out Caltech alum Henry Baer's 2015 SCIAC Championship performance by 0.16 seconds, good enough for fourth place all-time in school history.
                Another notable performance came from junior
