          <p>Our group is focused on developing new MRI techniques, and in particular, developing novel applications for children.  We take a comprehensive approach, exploring novel hardware, data acquisition, image reconstruction, and image analysis techniques.  These approaches are then evaluated for cardiovascular, abdominal, and musculoskeletal pediatric MRI exams.  Additionally, we seek to develop quantitative MRI methods, including those for cardiovascular function, renal function, and tumor perfusion.</p>

                <p>The overall goal of this project is to develop and validate a novel technique for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-based Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM) of the abdomen, for non-invasive assessment of liver iron deposition. In this work, study team will develop and optimize advanced data acquisition and image reconstruction methods to enable QSM of the abdomen. Further, investigators will determine the accuracy, repeatability, and reproducibility of abdominal QSM for iron quantification in patients with liver iron overload.

Excessive accumulation of iron in various organs, including the liver, which affects both adult and pediatric populations, is toxic and requires treatment aimed at reducing body iron stores. Accurate assessment of liver iron concentration is critical for the detection and staging of iron overload as well as for longitudinal monitoring during treatment.

In summary, this project will develop a novel MRI-based QSM technique designed for the abdomen and will validate it in pediatric and adult patients with liver iron overload. Upon successful validation, QSM will provide accurate, repeatable, and reproducible quantification of LIC based on a fundamental property of tissue.</p>

The proposed technique can complement existing sensors which are difficult to apply for certain patient populations.We leverage a software-defined radio for continuous wave radar at 2.4 GHz to detect in-vivo respiratory and cardiac timescrolled signals. In-bore radar signal demodulation is verified with full electromagnetic simulations, and its functionality is validated on a test bench and within the MR bore with four normal subjects. Radar sensing was compared against well-known references: electrocardiography on a test bench, system bellows, and pulsed plethysmography sensors with in the MRI bore.The feasibility of noncontact cardiac rate sensing, dynamic breathing sequence synchronization, and in-bore motion correction for retrospective respiratory gating applications was demonstrated. Optimal radar front-end system arrangement, along with spectral isolation and narrow bandwidth of operation, enable MRI-compatible and interference-free motion sensing. The signal-to-noise-ratio degradation by the radar integration was within 4.5% on phantom images.We confirmed that in-bore retrospective motion correction using CW Doppler radar is feasible without MRI system constraints.Non-contact motion correction sensing in MRI may provide better patient handling and through put by complementing existing system sensors and motion correction algorithms.&#34;},{&#34;apaCitation&#34;:&#34;Shin, H.

Subjects with known or suspected liver iron overload underwent multi-echo spoiled gradient-recalled-echo scans at each field strength. A subset received repeatability testing at either 1.5T or 3T. Susceptibility and   R 2 *  $$ {\\mathrm{R}}_2^{\\ast } $$  maps were reconstructed from the multi-echo images and analyzed at a single center. QSM-measured susceptibility was compared with   R 2 *  $$ {\\mathrm{R}}_2^{\\ast } $$  and a commercial R2-based liver iron concentration method across centers and field strengths using linear regression and F-tests on the intercept and slope. Field-strength reproducibility and test/retest repeatability were evaluated using Bland-Altman analysis.RESULTS: A total of 155/80 data sets (test/retest) were available at 1.5T, and 159/70 data sets (test/retest) were available at 3T. Calibrations across sites were reproducible, with some variability (e.g., susceptibility slope with liver iron concentration ranged from 0.102 to 0.123g/[mg  · $$ \\cdotp $$  ppm] across centers at 1.5T). Field strength reproducibility was good (concordance correlation coefficient=0.862), and test/retest repeatability was excellent (intraclass correlation coefficient=0.951).CONCLUSION: QSM as an imaging biomarker of liver iron overload is feasible and repeatable across centers and MR vendors. It may be complementary with   R 2 *  $$ {\\mathrm{R}}_2^{\\ast } $$  as they are obtained from the same acquisition. Although good reproducibility was observed, liver QSM may benefit from standardization of acquisition parameters.

Field-strength reproducibility and test/retest repeatability were evaluated using Bland-Altman analysis.RESULTS: A total of 155/80 data sets (test/retest) were available at 1.5T, and 159/70 data sets (test/retest) were available at 3T. Calibrations across sites were reproducible, with some variability (e.g., susceptibility slope with liver iron concentration ranged from 0.102 to 0.123g/[mg  · $$ \\cdotp $$  ppm] across centers at 1.5T). Field strength reproducibility was good (concordance correlation coefficient=0.862), and test/retest repeatability was excellent (intraclass correlation coefficient=0.951).CONCLUSION: QSM as an imaging biomarker of liver iron overload is feasible and repeatable across centers and MR vendors. It may be complementary with   R 2 *  $$ {\\mathrm{R}}_2^{\\ast } $$  as they are obtained from the same acquisition. Although good reproducibility was observed, liver QSM may benefit from standardization of acquisition parameters. Overall, QSM is a promising method for liver iron quantification.\nDOI: 10.1002/mrm.30251, https://doi.org/10.1002/mrm.30251\n\nPubMedID: 39238238, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39238238&#34;,&#34;value&#34;:null},&#34;doiId&#34;:&#34;10.1002/mrm.30251&#34;,&#34;doiUrl&#34;:&#34;https://doi.org/10.1002/mrm.30251&#34;,&#34;featured&#34;:false,&#34;firstPublished&#34;:{&#34;html&#34;:&#34;Sep 5, 2024 00:00:00 AM&#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;Sep 5, 2024 00:00:00 AM&#34;,&#34;value&#34;:&#34;2024-09-05T00:00:00.000-07:00&#34;},&#34;mlaCitation&#34;:&#34;Buelo, Collin J. et al. “Multicenter, Multivendor Validation of Liver Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping in Patients with Iron Overload at 1.5T and 3T.” &lt;i>Magnetic resonance in medicine&lt;/i> (2024): n. pag.

In this phase II imaging study, we assessed the feasibility, safety, and diagnostic performance of 68Ga-NeoB and 68Ga-PSMA-R2 PET/MRI for detection of biochemically recurrent PC. Methods: We prospectively enrolled 27 men with suspected biochemically recurrent PC after initial treatment but noncontributory conventional imaging results (negative or equivocal findings on MRI, CT, and/or bone scan). Participants underwent 68Ga-NeoB and 68Ga-PSMA-R2 PET/MRI within 2 wk in noncontrolled order. The SUVmax of putative PC lesions was measured and compared with a composite reference standard (histopathology, follow-up imaging, prostate-specific antigen change). The SUVmax and SUVmean of background organs were measured. Vital signs were recorded before injection of the radiopharmaceuticals and after the scans. Adverse events were recorded up to 72 h after each scan. Results: The prostate-specific antigen level at enrollment was 3.5 ± 3.9 ng/mL (range, 0.3-13.5 ng/mL). 68Ga-NeoB PET/MRI detected 31 lesions in 18 patients (66.7%), whereas 68Ga-PSMA-R2 identified 20 lesions in 15 participants (55.6%). 68Ga-NeoB PET/MRI showed higher sensitivity (85.7% vs. 71.4%), accuracy (88.9% vs. 77.8%), and negative predictive value (66.7% vs. 50.0%) than 68Ga-PSMA-R2, whereas specificity and positive predictive value were equally high (100.0% for both). In 6 patients, 68Ga-NeoB PET/MRI identified 14 lesions that were false-negative on 68Ga-PSMA-R2 PET/MRI. The mean lesion SUVmax was 6.6 ± 3.2 (range, 2.9-13.2) for 68Ga-NeoB and 4.4 ± 1.5 (range, 2.6-8.8) for 68Ga-PSMA-R2 (P = 0.019). Overall lower uptake was noted in tumors and background organs for 68Ga-PSMA-R2. There were no significant changes in vital signs before and after the scans. No adverse events were reported in the 72-h period after scans. Conclusion: 68Ga-NeoB and 68Ga-PSMA-R2 are safe for diagnostic imaging. 68Ga-NeoB PET/MRI showed better diagnostic performance than 68Ga-PSMA-R2. 68Ga-PSMA-R2 showed overall lower uptake, equally in background organs and tumors, and might therefore not be an ideal theranostic compound.

In 6 patients, 68Ga-NeoB PET/MRI identified 14 lesions that were false-negative on 68Ga-PSMA-R2 PET/MRI. The mean lesion SUVmax was 6.6 ± 3.2 (range, 2.9-13.2) for 68Ga-NeoB and 4.4 ± 1.5 (range, 2.6-8.8) for 68Ga-PSMA-R2 (P = 0.019). Overall lower uptake was noted in tumors and background organs for 68Ga-PSMA-R2. There were no significant changes in vital signs before and after the scans. No adverse events were reported in the 72-h period after scans. Conclusion: 68Ga-NeoB and 68Ga-PSMA-R2 are safe for diagnostic imaging. 68Ga-NeoB PET/MRI showed better diagnostic performance than 68Ga-PSMA-R2. 68Ga-PSMA-R2 showed overall lower uptake, equally in background organs and tumors, and might therefore not be an ideal theranostic compound.

In this phase II imaging study, we assessed the feasibility, safety, and diagnostic performance of 68Ga-NeoB and 68Ga-PSMA-R2 PET/MRI for detection of biochemically recurrent PC. Methods: We prospectively enrolled 27 men with suspected biochemically recurrent PC after initial treatment but noncontributory conventional imaging results (negative or equivocal findings on MRI, CT, and/or bone scan). Participants underwent 68Ga-NeoB and 68Ga-PSMA-R2 PET/MRI within 2 wk in noncontrolled order. The SUVmax of putative PC lesions was measured and compared with a composite reference standard (histopathology, follow-up imaging, prostate-specific antigen change). The SUVmax and SUVmean of background organs were measured. Vital signs were recorded before injection of the radiopharmaceuticals and after the scans. Adverse events were recorded up to 72 h after each scan. Results: The prostate-specific antigen level at enrollment was 3.5 ± 3.9 ng/mL (range, 0.3-13.5 ng/mL). 68Ga-NeoB PET/MRI detected 31 lesions in 18 patients (66.7%), whereas 68Ga-PSMA-R2 identified 20 lesions in 15 participants (55.6%). 68Ga-NeoB PET/MRI showed higher sensitivity (85.7% vs. 71.4%), accuracy (88.9% vs. 77.8%), and negative predictive value (66.7% vs. 50.0%) than 68Ga-PSMA-R2, whereas specificity and positive predictive value were equally high (100.0% for both).

However, targeting a single tumour characteristic might not be sufficient to reflect the full extent of disease. Gastrin releasing peptide receptors (GRPR) have been shown to be overexpressed in prostate cancer. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the GRPR-targeting radiopharmaceutical 68Ga-RM2 in patients with biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer.This single-centre, single-arm, phase 2/3 trial was done at Stanford University (USA). Adult patients (aged ≥18 years) with biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer, a Karnofsky performance status of 50 or higher, increasing prostate-specific antigen concentration 0·2 ng/mL or more after prostatectomy or 2 ng/mL or more above nadir after radiotherapy, and non-contributory conventional imaging (negative CT or MRI, and bone scan) were eligible. All participants underwent 68Ga-RM2 PET-MRI. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with PET-positive findings on 68Ga-RM2 PET-MRI compared with MRI alone after initial therapy, at a per-patient and per-lesion level. The primary outcome would be considered met if at least 30% of patients had one or more lesions detected by 68Ga-RM2 PET-MRI and the detection by 68Ga-RM2 PET-MRI was significantly greater than for MRI. Each PET scan was interpreted by three independent masked readers using a standardised evaluation criteria. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02624518, and is complete.Between Dec 12, 2015, and July 27, 2021, 209 men were screened for eligibility, of whom 100 were included in analyses. Median follow-up was 49·3 months (IQR 36·7-59·2). The primary endpoint was met; 68Ga-RM2 PET-MRI was positive in 69 (69%) patients and MRI alone was positive in 40 (40%) patients (p&lt;0·0001). In the per-lesion analysis 68Ga-RM2 PET-MRI showed significantly higher detection rates than MRI alone (143 vs 96 lesions; p&lt;0·0001). No grade 1 or worse events were reported.68Ga-RM2 PET-MRI showed better diagnostic performance than MRI alone in patients with biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer.

Noise2Recon uses unlabeled data by enforcing consistency between model reconstructions of undersampled scans and their noise-augmented counterparts. Noise2Recon was compared to compressed sensing and both supervised and self-supervised deep learning baselines. Experiments were conducted using retrospectively accelerated data from the mridata three-dimensional fast-spin-echo knee and two-dimensional fastMRI brain datasets. All methods were evaluated in label-limited settings and among out-of-distribution (OOD) shifts, including changes in SNR, acceleration factors, and datasets. An extensive ablation study was conducted to characterize the sensitivity of Noise2Recon to hyperparameter choices.RESULTS: In label-limited settings, Noise2Recon achieved better structural similarity, peak signal-to-noise ratio, and normalized-RMS error than all baselines and matched performance of supervised models, which were trained with  14 * $$ 14\\times $$  more fully sampled scans. Noise2Recon outperformed all baselines, including state-of-the-art fine-tuning and augmentation techniques, among low-SNR scans and when generalizing to OOD acceleration factors. Augmentation extent and loss weighting hyperparameters had negligible impact on Noise2Recon compared to supervised methods, which may indicate increased training stability.CONCLUSION: Noise2Recon is a label-efficient reconstruction method that is robust to distribution shifts, such as changes in SNR, acceleration factors, and others, with limited or no fully sampled training data.&#34;},{&#34;apaCitation&#34;:&#34;Tan, F., Zhu, X., Chan, M., Zapala, M.

We improve its design process to generate pulses with lower energy (by as much as 26%) and more accurate phase profiles. Concretely, the SLR algorithm consists of two steps: (1) an invertible transform between frequency selective pulses and polynomial pairs that represent Cayley-Klein (CK) parameters and (2) the design of the CK polynomial pair to match the desired magnetization profiles. Because the CK polynomial pair is bi-linearly coupled, the original algorithm sequentially solves for each polynomial instead of jointly. This results in sub-optimal pulses.

Compared with regulatory-approved R2 MRI, R2* MRI has superior speed and is available in most MRI scanners; however, the cross-vendor reproducibility of R2*-based LIC estimation remains unknown. Purpose To evaluate the reproducibility of LIC via single-breath-hold R2* MRI at both 1.5 T and 3.0 T with use of a multicenter, multivendor study. Materials and Methods Four academic medical centers using MRI scanners from three different vendors (three 1.5-T scanners, one 2.89-T scanner, and two 3.0-T scanners) participated in this prospective cross-sectional study. Participants with known or suspected liver iron overload were recruited to undergo multiecho gradient-echo MRI for R2* mapping at 1.5 T and 3.0 T (2.89 T or 3.0 T) on the same day. R2* maps were reconstructed from the multiecho images and analyzed at a single center. Reference LIC measurements were obtained with a commercial R2 MRI method performed using standardized 1.5-T spin-echo imaging. R2*-versus-LIC calibrations were generated across centers and field strengths using linear regression and compared using F tests. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to determine the diagnostic performance of R2* MRI in the detection of clinically relevant LIC thresholds. Results A total of 207 participants (mean age, 38 years ± 20 [SD]; 117 male participants) were evaluated between March 2015 and September 2019. A linear relationship was confirmed between R2* and LIC. All calibrations within the same field strength were highly reproducible, showing no evidence of statistically significant center-specific differences (P > .43 across all comparisons). Calibrations for 1.5 T and 3.0 T were generated, as follows: for 1.5 T, LIC (in milligrams per gram [dry weight]) = -0.16 + 2.603 * 10-2 R2* (in seconds-1); for 2.89 T, LIC (in milligrams per gram) = -0.03 + 1.400 * 10-2 R2* (in seconds-1); for 3.0 T, LIC (in milligrams per gram) = -0.03 + 1.349 * 10-2 R2* (in seconds-1). Liver R2* had high diagnostic performance in the detection of clinically relevant LIC thresholds (area under the ROC curve, >0.98). Conclusion R2* MRI enabled accurate and reproducible quantification of liver iron overload over clinically relevant ranges of liver iron concentration (LIC). The data generated in this study provide the necessary calibrations for broad clinical dissemination of R2*-based LIC quantification.

The ability to effectively compensate for this reduced dynamic range encourages further investigation of low-power SiGe amplifiers for power limited MRI receive arrays.\nDOI: 10.1109/TMI.2022.3195656, https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2022.3195656\n\nPubMedID: 35914030, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35914030&#34;,&#34;value&#34;:null},&#34;doiId&#34;:&#34;10.1109/TMI.2022.3195656&#34;,&#34;doiUrl&#34;:&#34;https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2022.3195656&#34;,&#34;featured&#34;:false,&#34;firstPublished&#34;:{&#34;html&#34;:&#34;Aug 1, 2022 00:00:00 AM&#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;Aug 1, 2022 00:00:00 AM&#34;,&#34;value&#34;:&#34;2022-08-01T00:00:00.000-07:00&#34;},&#34;mlaCitation&#34;:&#34;Vassos, Christopher et al. “A Semi-Blind Calibration and Compensation Method for Dynamic Range Recovery of Low-Power Pre-Amplifiers in MRI Receive Chains.” &lt;i>IEEE transactions on medical imaging&lt;/i> PP (2022): n. pag.

To address this, a low-power SiGe alternative to industry standard MRI pre-amplifier blocks has been proposed and its impact on imaging performance evaluated in a benchtop environment. The SiGe amplifier reduces power consumption 28x, but exhibits increased non-linearity and reduced dynamic range relative to industry standard amplifiers. This distorts the images, causing reduced contrast and a blurring of fine features. In conjunction with the amplifier, a semi-blind calibration and compensation framework has been proposed to remove artifacts caused by this non-linearity. Requiring the knowledge of the calibration signal bandwidth, the associated peak transmit powers, and the distorted baseband signals, a second non-linearity is constructed that when cascaded with the receive chain produces a linear response. This method was evaluated for both knee and phantom image datasets of peak input power -20dBm with a -40dBm peak input power image as reference. In the benchtop environment, industry standard amplifiers produced input normalized RMSEs of 0.0199 and 0.0310 for phantom and knee datasets, respectively. The low-power SiGe amplifier resulted in RMSEs of 0.0869 and 0.1130 which were reduced to 0.0158 and 0.0168 following compensation, for phantom and knee images respectively. The ability to effectively compensate for this reduced dynamic range encourages further investigation of low-power SiGe amplifiers for power limited MRI receive arrays.&#34;},{&#34;apaCitation&#34;:&#34;Li, Z., Mathew, M., Syed, A.

If image quality is inadequate either patients have to return for an additional scan, or a suboptimal interpretation is rendered. An automatic image quality assessment (IQA) would enable real-time remediation. Existing IQA works for MRI give only a general quality score, agnostic to the cause of and solution to low-quality scans. Furthermore, radiologists&#39; image quality requirements vary with the scan type and diagnostic task. Therefore, the same score may have different implications for different scans. We propose a framework with multi-task CNN model trained with calibrated labels and inferenced with image rulers. Labels calibrated by human inputs follow a well-defined and efficient labeling task. Image rulers address varying quality standards and provide a concrete way of interpreting raw scores from the CNN. The model supports assessments of two of the most common artifacts in MRI: noise and motion. It achieves accuracies of around 90%, 6% better than the best previous method examined, and 3% better than human experts on noise assessment. Our experiments show that label calibration, image rulers, and multi-task training improve the model&#39;s performance and generalizability.&#34;},{&#34;apaCitation&#34;:&#34;Lee, P.

Purpose To assess the feasibility of using deep learning to automatically perform image-based background phase error correction in 4D flow MRI and to compare its effectiveness relative to manual image-based correction. Materials and Methods A convenience sample of 139 abdominopelvic 4D flow MRI acquisitions performed between January 2016 and July 2020 was retrospectively collected. Manual phase error correction was performed using dedicated imaging software and served as the reference standard. After reserving 40 examinations for testing, the remaining examinations were randomly divided into training (86% [85 of 99]) and validation (14% [14 of 99]) data sets to train a multichannel three-dimensional U-Net convolutional neural network. Flow measurements were obtained for the infrarenal aorta, common iliac arteries, common iliac veins, and inferior vena cava. Statistical analyses included Pearson correlation, Bland-Altman analysis, and F tests with Bonferroni correction. Results A total of 139 patients (mean age, 47 years ± 14 [standard deviation]; 108 women) were included. Inflow-outflow correlation improved after manual correction (rho = 0.94, P &lt; .001) compared with that before correction (rho = 0.50, P &lt; .001). Automated correction showed similar results (rho = 0.91, P &lt; .001) and demonstrated very strong correlation with manual correction (rho = 0.98, P &lt; .001). Both correction methods reduced inflow-outflow variance, improving mean difference from -0.14 L/min (95% limits of agreement: -1.61, 1.32) (uncorrected) to 0.05 L/min (95% limits of agreement: -0.32, 0.42) (manually corrected) and 0.05 L/min (95% limits of agreement: -0.38, 0.49) (automatically corrected). There was no significant difference in inflow-outflow variance between manual and automated correction methods (P = .10).

Zero echo time (ZTE) MR imaging produces a \&#34;CT-like\&#34; osseous contrast that might obviate CT.OBJECTIVE: This study investigated our institution&#39;s initial experience in implementing an isotropic ZTE MR imaging sequence for pediatric musculoskeletal examinations.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pediatric patients referred for extremity MRI at 3tesla (T) underwent ZTE MR imaging to yield images with contrast similar to that of CT. A radiograph-like image was also created with ray-sum image processing. We assessed ZTE-CT/XR anatomical image quality (Sanat) from 0 (nondiagnostic) to 5 (outstanding). Further, we made image comparisons on a 5-point scale (Scomp) (range of -2 = conventional CT/XR greater anatomical delineation to +2 = ZTE-CT/XR greater anatomical delineation; 0=same) for three cohorts: (1) ZTE-XR to conventional radiography, (2) ZTE-CT to conventional CT and (3) pathological lesion assessment on ZTE-XR to conventional radiography. We measured cortical thickness of ZTE-XR and ZTE-CT and compared these with conventional imaging. We calculated confidence interval of proportions, Wilcoxon rank sum test and intraclass correlation coefficients for inter-reader agreement.RESULTS: Cohorts 1, 2 and 3 consisted of 40, 20 and 35 cases, respectively (age range 0.6-23.0years). ZTE-CT versus CT and ZTE-XR versus radiography of cortical thicknesses were not significantly different (P=0.55 and P=0.31, respectively). Cortical delineation was rated diagnostic or better (score of 3, 4 or 5) in all cases (confidence interval of proportions = 100%) for ZTE-CT/XR. Similarly, intramedullary cavity delineation was rated diagnostic or better in all cases for ZTE-CT, and ZTE-XR was at least diagnostic in 58-63% of cases. For cohort 2, cortex and intramedullary cavity Scomp for ZTE-CT was comparable to those of conventional CT, with confidence interval of proportion (sum of score of -1 to +2) of 93-100% and 95%, respectively. Pathology visualized on ZTE-CT/XR was comparable; Scomp confidence interval of proportions was 95%/97-100%, with improved delineation of non-displaced fractures on ZTE-XR. Readers had moderate to near-perfect intraclass correlation coefficient (range=0.60-0.93).CONCLUSION: Implementation of a diagnostic-quality ZTE MRI sequence in the pediatric population is feasible and can be performed as a complementary pulse sequence to enhance musculoskeletal MRI studies.

Purpose To assess the image quality and performance of a highly accelerated, free-breathing, two-dimensional cine cardiac MRI sequence incorporating deep learning (DL) reconstruction compared with reference standard balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP). Materials and Methods A DL algorithm was developed to reconstruct custom 12-fold accelerated bSSFP cardiac MRI cine images from coil sensitivity maps using 15 iterations of separable three-dimensional convolutions and data consistency steps. The model was trained, validated, and internally tested in 10, two, and 10 adult human volunteers, respectively, based on vendor partner-supplied fully sampled bSSFP acquisitions. For prospective external clinical validation, consecutive children and young adults undergoing cardiac MRI from September through December 2019 at a single children&#39;s hospital underwent both conventional and highly accelerated short-axis bSSFP cine acquisitions in one MRI examination. Two radiologists scored overall and volumetric three-dimensional mesh image quality of all short-axis stacks on a five-point Likert scale and manually segmented endocardial and epicardial contours. Scan times and image quality were compared using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Measurement agreement was assessed with intraclass correlation coefficient and Bland-Altman analysis. Results Fifty participants (mean age, 16 years ± 4 [standard deviation]; range, 5-30 years; 29 men) were evaluated. The mean prescribed acquisition times of accelerated scans (non-breath-held) and bSSFP (excluding breath-hold time) were 0.9 minute ± 0.3 versus 3.0 minutes ± 1.9 (P &lt; .001). Overall and three-dimensional mesh image quality scores were, respectively, 3.8 ± 0.6 versus 4.3 ± 0.6 (P &lt; .001) and 4.0 ± 1.0 versus 4.4 ± 0.8 (P &lt; .001). Raters had strong agreement between all bSSFP and DL measurements, with intraclass correlation coefficients of 0.76 to 0.97, near-zero mean differences, and narrow limits of agreement. Conclusion With slightly lower image quality yet much faster speed, deep learning reconstruction may allow substantially shorter acquisition times of cardiac MRI compared with conventional balanced steady-state free precession MRI performed for ventricular volumetry. © RSNA, 2021 Online supplemental material is available for this article.&lt;/p>\n  &lt;p class=\&#34;doi\&#34;>\n    &lt;span>View details for &lt;a href=\&#34;https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.2021202624\&#34;>DOI 10.1148/radiol.2021202624&lt;/a>&lt;/span>\n  &lt;/p>\n  &lt;p class=\&#34;pub-med\&#34;>\n    &lt;span>View details for &lt;a href=\&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34128724\&#34;>PubMedID 34128724&lt;/a>&lt;/span>\n  &lt;/p>&#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;Abstract:\nBackground Obtaining ventricular volumetry and mass is key to most cardiac MRI but challenged by long multibreath-hold acquisitions. Purpose To assess the image quality and performance of a highly accelerated, free-breathing, two-dimensional cine cardiac MRI sequence incorporating deep learning (DL) reconstruction compared with reference standard balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP). Materials and Methods A DL algorithm was developed to reconstruct custom 12-fold accelerated bSSFP cardiac MRI cine images from coil sensitivity maps using 15 iterations of separable three-dimensional convolutions and data consistency steps. The model was trained, validated, and internally tested in 10, two, and 10 adult human volunteers, respectively, based on vendor partner-supplied fully sampled bSSFP acquisitions. For prospective external clinical validation, consecutive children and young adults undergoing cardiac MRI from September through December 2019 at a single children&#39;s hospital underwent both conventional and highly accelerated short-axis bSSFP cine acquisitions in one MRI examination. Two radiologists scored overall and volumetric three-dimensional mesh image quality of all short-axis stacks on a five-point Likert scale and manually segmented endocardial and epicardial contours. Scan times and image quality were compared using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Measurement agreement was assessed with intraclass correlation coefficient and Bland-Altman analysis. Results Fifty participants (mean age, 16 years ± 4 [standard deviation]; range, 5-30 years; 29 men) were evaluated. The mean prescribed acquisition times of accelerated scans (non-breath-held) and bSSFP (excluding breath-hold time) were 0.9 minute ± 0.3 versus 3.0 minutes ± 1.9 (P &lt; .001).

Still, there are challenges to incorporating neuroimaging biomarkers into multisite randomised controlled trials. In this paper, we provide the rationale for incorporating MRI and MRS biomarkers into the multisite, phase III high-dose erythropoietin for asphyxia and encephalopathy (HEAL) Trial, the MRI/S protocol and describe the strategies used for harmonisation across multiple MRI platforms.METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Neonates with moderate or severe encephalopathy enrolled in the multisite HEAL trial undergo MRI and MRS between 96 and 144 hours of age using standardised neuroimaging protocols. MRI and MRS data are processed centrally and used to determine a brain injury score and quantitative measures of lactate and n-acetylaspartate. Harmonisation is achieved through standardisation-thereby reducing intrasite and intersite variance, real-time quality assurance monitoring and phantom scans.ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: IRB approval was obtained at each participating site and written consent obtained from parents prior to participation in HEAL.

Additionally, we propose a novel neural network design based on (2+1)D spatiotemporal convolutions to produce more accurate dynamic MRI reconstructions than conventional 3D convolutions. The network is trained on fully sampled 2D cardiac cine datasets collected from 11 healthy volunteers with IRB approval. DL-ESPIRiT is compared against a state-of-the-art parallel imaging and compressed sensing method known as l 1  -ESPIRiT. The reconstruction accuracy of both methods is evaluated on retrospectively undersampled datasets (R=12) with respect to standard image quality metrics as well as automatic deep learning-based segmentations of left ventricular volumes. Feasibility of DL-ESPIRiT is demonstrated on two prospectively undersampled datasets acquired in a single heartbeat per slice.RESULTS: The (2+1)D DL-ESPIRiT method produces higher fidelity image reconstructions when compared to l 1  -ESPIRiT reconstructions with respect to standard image quality metrics (P &lt; .001). As a result of improved image quality, segmentations made from (2+1)D DL-ESPIRiT images are also more accurate than segmentations from l 1  -ESPIRiT images.CONCLUSIONS: DL-ESPIRiT synergistically combines a robust parallel imaging model and deep learning-based priors to produce high-fidelity reconstructions of retrospectively undersampled 2D cardiac cine data acquired with reduced FOV.

We aimed to validate direct measurement of the AVVR jet as accurate and reliable compared to the volumetric method (clinical standard by 2D CMR) and as a superior method of internal validation than the annular inflow method.METHODS: We identified 44 consecutive patients with diverse CHD referred for evaluation of AVVR by CMR. 1.5T or 3T scanners, intravenous contrast, and a combination of parallel imaging and compressed sensing were used. Four methods of measuring AVVR volume (RVol) were used: volumetric method (VOL; the clinical standard)=stroke volume by 2D balanced steady-state free precession - semilunar valve forward flow (SLFF); annular inflow method (AIM)=atrioventricular valve forward flow [AVFF] - semilunar valve net flow (SLNF); and direct measurement (JET).

This reconstruction is vastly under-determined, heavily stressing computing resources as well as memory management and storage. To overcome these challenges, we leverage intrinsic three-dimensional (3D) trajectories, such as 3D radial and 3D cones, with ordering that incoherently cover time and k-space over the entire acquisition. We then propose two innovations: (a) A compressed representation using multiscale low-rank matrix factorization that constrains the reconstruction problem, and reduces its memory footprint. (b) Stochastic optimization to reduce computation, improve memory locality, and minimize communications between threads and processors. We demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method on DCE imaging acquired with a golden-angle ordered 3D cones trajectory and pulmonary imaging acquired with a bit-reversed ordered 3D radial trajectory. We compare it with \&#34;soft-gated\&#34; dynamic reconstruction for DCE and respiratory-resolved reconstruction for pulmonary imaging.RESULTS: The proposed technique shows transient dynamics that are not seen in gating-based methods. When applied to datasets with irregular, or non-repetitive motions, the proposed method displays sharper image features.CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated a method that can reconstruct massive 3D dynamic image series in the extreme undersampling and extreme computation setting.&lt;/p>\n  &lt;p class=\&#34;doi\&#34;>\n    &lt;span>View details for &lt;a href=\&#34;https://doi.org/10.1002/mrm.28235\&#34;>DOI 10.1002/mrm.28235&lt;/a>&lt;/span>\n  &lt;/p>\n  &lt;p class=\&#34;pub-med\&#34;>\n    &lt;span>View details for &lt;a href=\&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32270547\&#34;>PubMedID 32270547&lt;/a>&lt;/span>\n  &lt;/p>&#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;Abstract:\nPURPOSE: To develop a framework to reconstruct large-scale volumetric dynamic MRI from rapid continuous and non-gated acquisitions, with applications to pulmonary and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) imaging.THEORY AND METHODS: The problem considered here requires recovering 100 gigabytes of dynamic volumetric image data from a few gigabytes of k-space data, acquired continuously over several minutes.

Here, we use four such age estimators to show that epigenetic aging can be reversed in humans. Using a protocol intended to regenerate the thymus, we observed protective immunological changes, improved risk indices for many age-related diseases, and a mean epigenetic age approximately 1.5years less than baseline after 1year of treatment (-2.5-year change compared to no treatment at the end of the study). The rate of epigenetic aging reversal relative to chronological age accelerated from -1.6year/year from 0-9month to -6.5year/year from 9-12month. The GrimAge predictor of human morbidity and mortality showed a 2-year decrease in epigenetic vs. chronological age that persisted six months after discontinuing treatment.

We sought to determine how often DCE is used in PI-RADS v2 scoring.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed data from 388 patients who underwent prostate magnetic resonance imaging and subsequent biopsy from January 2016 through December 2017. In accordance with PI-RADS v2, DCE was deemed necessary if a peripheral-zone lesion had a diffusion-weighted imaging score of 3, or if a transition-zone lesion had a T2 score of 3 and diffusion-weighted imaging experienced technical failure. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis assessed the accuracy of prostate-specific antigen density (PSAD) at different threshold values for differentiating lesions that would be equivocal with noncontrast technique. Accuracy of PSAD was compared to DCE using McNemar&#39;s test.RESULTS: Sixty-nine lesions in 62 patients (16%) required DCE for PI-RADS scoring. Biopsy of 10 (14%) of these lesions showed clinically significant cancer (Gleason score ≥7). In the subgroup of patients with equivocal lesions, those with clinically significant cancer had significantly higher PSADs than those with clinically insignificant lesions (means of 0.18 and 0.13 ng/mL/mL, respectively; P= 0.038). In this subgroup, there was no statistical difference in accuracy in determining clinically significant cancer between a PSAD threshold value of 0.13 and DCE (P= 0.25).CONCLUSIONS: Only 16% of our patients needed DCE to generate the PI-RADS version 2 score, raising the possibility of limiting the initial screening prostate MRI to a noncontrast exam.

An MRI compatible wireless power transfer (WPT) system will be needed to realize this technology. An MRI WPT system must withstand the extreme electromagnetic environment of the scanner and cannot degrade MRI image quality. Here, a WPT system is developed for operation in MRI scanners using new microelectromechanical RF switch (RF MEMs) technology. The WPT system includes a class-E power amplifier, RF MEMs automated impedance matching, a primary coil array employing RF MEMs power steering, and a flexible secondary coil with class E rectification. To adapt WPT technology to MRI, techniques are developed for operation at high magnetic field, and to mitigate the RF interactions between the scanner and WPT system. A major challenge was the identification and suppression of noise and harmonic interference, by gating, filtering, and rectifier topologies. The system can achieve 63% efficiency while exceeding 13 W delivery over a coil distance of 3.5 cm. For continuous WPT beyond 5W, added filters and full-wave class E rectification lowers harmonic generation at some cost to efficiency, while image SNR reaches about 32% of the ideal. RF-gated WPT, which interrupts power transfer in the MRI signal acquisition interval, achieves SNR performance to within 1 dB of the ideal. With further refinement, the inclusion of WPT technology in MRI scanners appears completely feasible.&#34;},{&#34;apaCitation&#34;:&#34;Winkler, S.

Purpose To assess the performance and caregiver and clinician acceptance of a pediatric-sized screen-printed flexible MRI coil array as compared with conventional coil technology. Materials and Methods A pediatric-sized 12-channel coil array was designed by using a screen-printing process. Element coupling and phantom signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were assessed. Subjects were scanned by using the pediatric printed array between September and November 2017; results were compared with three age- and sex-matched historical control subjects by using a commercial 32-channel cardiac array at 3 T. Caregiver acceptance was assessed by asking nurses, technologists, anesthesiologists, and subjects or parents to rate their coil preference. Diagnostic quality of the images was evaluated by using a Likert scale (5 = high image quality, 1 = nondiagnostic). Image SNR was evaluated and compared. Results Twenty study participants were evaluated with the screen-printed coil (age range, 2 days to 12 years; 11 male and nine female subjects). Loaded pediatric phantom testing yielded similar noise covariance matrices and only slightly degraded SNR for the printed coil as compared with the commercial coil. The caregiver acceptance survey yielded a mean score of 4.1 ± 0.6 (scale: 1, preferred the commercial coil; 5, preferred the printed coil). Diagnostic quality score was 4.5 ± 0.6. Mean image SNR was 54 ± 49 (paraspinal muscle), 78 ± 51 (abdominal wall muscle), and 59 ± 35 (psoas) for the printed coil, as compared with 64 ± 55, 65 ± 48, and 57 ± 43, respectively, for the commercial coil; these SNR differences were not statistically significant (P = .26).

The 10-minute protocol was based on T2 Shuffling, a four-dimensional acquisition and reconstruction of images with variable T2 contrast, and a T1 2D fast spin-echo (FSE) sequence. A distributed, compressed sensing-based reconstruction was implemented on a four-node high-performance compute cluster and integrated into the clinical workflow.ASSESSMENT: In an Institutional Review Board-approved study with informed consent/assent, we implemented a targeted pediatric knee MRI exam for assessing pediatric knee pain. Pediatric patients were subselected for the exam based on insurance plan and clinical indication. Over a 2-year period, 47 subjects were recruited for the study and 49 MRIs were ordered. Date and time information was recorded for MRI referral, registration, and completion. Image quality was assessed from 0 (nondiagnostic) to 5 (outstanding) by two readers, and consensus was subsequently reached.STATISTICAL TESTS: A Wilcoxon rank-sum test assessed the null hypothesis that the targeted exam times compared with conventional knee exam times were unchanged.RESULTS: Of the 49 cases, 20 were completed on the same day as exam referral. Median time from registration to exam completion was 18.7 minutes. Median reconstruction time for T2 Shuffling was reduced from 18.9 minutes to 95 seconds using the distributed implementation. Technical fees charged for the targeted exam were one-third that of the routine clinical knee exam. No subject had to return for additional imaging.DATA CONCLUSION: The targeted knee MRI exam is feasible and reduces the imaging time, cost, and barrier to same-day MRI access for pediatric patients.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 2 Technical Efficacy: Stage 6 J.

The time and resource intensive computations require tradeoffs between accuracy and speed. In addition, state-of-the-art compressed sensing (CS) analytics are not cognizant of the image diagnostic quality. To address these challenges, we propose a novel CS framework that uses generative adversarial networks (GAN) to model the (low-dimensional) manifold of high-quality MR images. Leveraging a mixture of least-squares (LS) GANs and pixel-wise l1/l2 cost, a deep residual network with skip connections is trained as the generator that learns to remove the aliasing artifacts by projecting onto the image manifold. The LSGAN learns the texture details, while the l1/l2 cost suppresses high-frequency noise. A discriminator network, which is a multilayer convolutional neural network (CNN), plays the role of a perceptual cost that is then jointly trained based on high-quality MR images to score the quality of retrieved images. In the operational phase, an initial aliased estimate (e.g., simply obtained by zero-filling) is propagated into the trained generator to output the desired reconstruction. This demands a very low computational overhead. Extensive evaluations are performed on a large contrast-enhanced MR dataset of pediatric patients. Images rated by expert radiologists corroborate that GANCS retrieves higher quality images with improved fine texture details compared with conventional Wavelet-based and dictionary-learning-based CS schemes as well as with deep-learning-based schemes using pixel-wise training. In addition, it offers reconstruction times of under a few milliseconds, which are two orders of magnitude faster than the current state-of-the-art CS-MRI schemes.&#34;},{&#34;apaCitation&#34;:&#34;Zeng, D.

Realistic anatomic models, particularly those of the abdominal wall, are needed to take full advantage of the capabilities of these simulation tools. We describe a method for converting fat-water-separated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) volumes to anatomical models for ultrasound simulations. These acoustic models are used to map acoustic imaging parameters, such as speed of sound and density, to grid points in an ultrasound simulation. The tissues of these models are segmented from the MRI volumes into five primary classes of tissue in the human abdominal wall (skin, fat, muscle, connective tissue, and nontissue). This segmentation is achieved using an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, fuzzy c-means clustering (FCM), on a multiscale feature representation of the MRI volumes. We describe an automated method for utilizing FCM weights to produce a model that achieves \n                        \n                            ∼\n                            90\n                            %\n                        \n                     agreement with manual segmentation.

We assessed the performance of free-breathing conical UTE MRI in the evaluation of the pediatric pelvis for suspected appendicitis.METHODS: Our retrospective review of 84 pediatric patients who underwent MRI for suspected appendicitis compared three contrast-enhanced sequences: free-breathing conical UTE, breath-hold three-dimensional (3D) spoiled gradient echo (BH-SPGR), and free-breathing high-resolution 3D SPGR (FB-SPGR). Two radiologists performed blinded and independent evaluations of each sequence for image quality (four point scale), anatomic delineation (four point scale), and diagnostic confidence (five point scale). Subsequently, the three sequences were directly compared for overall image quality (-3 to +3 scale). Scores were compared using Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests.RESULTS: UTE demonstrated significantly better perceived signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and fewer artifacts than BH-SPGR and FB-SPGR (means of 3.6 and 3.4, 3.4 and 3.2, 3.1 and 2.7, respectively; p&lt;0.0006).

We assessed the performance of free-breathing conical UTE MRI in the evaluation of the pediatric pelvis for suspected appendicitis.METHODS: Our retrospective review of 84 pediatric patients who underwent MRI for suspected appendicitis compared three contrast-enhanced sequences: free-breathing conical UTE, breath-hold three-dimensional (3D) spoiled gradient echo (BH-SPGR), and free-breathing high-resolution 3D SPGR (FB-SPGR). Two radiologists performed blinded and independent evaluations of each sequence for image quality (four point scale), anatomic delineation (four point scale), and diagnostic confidence (five point scale). Subsequently, the three sequences were directly compared for overall image quality (-3 to +3 scale).

Here, we report a pilot study evaluating patients with suspected cardiac amyloidosis for systemic extent of disease.METHODS: We prospectively enrolled nine patients, 61-86year old (mean±SD 69.4±8.6), referred from the cardiac amyloid clinic. First, dynamic imaging of the heart was acquired immediately after injection of 222-318.2MBq (mean±SD 270.1±33.3) of 18F-florbetaben using the GE SIGNA PET/MRI. This was followed by a whole-body PET/MRI scan 60-146.4min (mean±SD 98±33.4) after injection. Cardiac MRI sequences included ECG-triggered cine SSFP, T2-weighted, and late gadolinium-enhanced imaging. Whole-body MRI sequences included MRAC and axial T1-weighted imaging.RESULTS: High early uptake and delayed high uptake in the left ventricle correlated with amyloid deposition in five patients, while low uptake on early and delayed cardiac imaging was noted in four patients. Cardiac function measurements were successfully obtained in all participants. Areas of increased abnormal 18F-florbetaben accumulation were noted on delayed whole-body imaging in the bone marrow (seven patients), stomach (diffuse in five patients and focal in one patient), brain (five patients), salivary glands (three patients), tongue (three patients), spleen (three patients), skeletal muscles (three patients), ocular muscles (two patients), thyroid (two patients), pleura (two patients), kidneys (two patients), and lungs (two patients).CONCLUSIONS: Whole-body 18F-florbetaben PET/MRI is promising for localization of systemic amyloid deposition.

The purpose of our investigation was to evaluate the safety of ferumoxytol in children undergoing general anaesthesia for cardiac MRI.METHODS: Medical records of children undergoing general anaesthesia for cardiac MRI were reviewed. Baseline demographic and medical characteristics, as well as imaging and anaesthetic duration and technique, were collected. The incidence of hypotension or other adverse events&#39;, need for vasoactive support, or airway intervention throughout the anaesthetic, was recorded.RESULTS: A total of 95 patients were identified, 61 received ferumoxytol and 34 received gadolinium. There were no significant differences between groups with respect to age, weight, or baseline blood pressure. The incidence of low blood pressure - systolic or mean - after contrast administration did not differ between groups, and there was no difference in sustained hypotension or use of vasopressors between groups. One patient who received ferumoxytol had possible anaphylaxis. The image acquisition time (45 versus 68 min, p=0.002) and anaesthesia duration (100 versus 132 min, p=0.02) were shorter in the ferumoxytol group.CONCLUSION: Transient low blood pressure was common in children undergoing cardiac MRI with anaesthesia, but the incidence of hypotension did not differ between ferumoxytol and gadolinium groups.

The incidence of low blood pressure - systolic or mean - after contrast administration did not differ between groups, and there was no difference in sustained hypotension or use of vasopressors between groups. One patient who received ferumoxytol had possible anaphylaxis. The image acquisition time (45 versus 68 min, p=0.002) and anaesthesia duration (100 versus 132 min, p=0.02) were shorter in the ferumoxytol group.CONCLUSION: Transient low blood pressure was common in children undergoing cardiac MRI with anaesthesia, but the incidence of hypotension did not differ between ferumoxytol and gadolinium groups. The use of ferumoxytol was associated with significantly shorter scan time and anaesthesia duration, as well as a decreased need for airway intervention.\n\n\nPubMedID: 29848399, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29848399&#34;,&#34;value&#34;:null},&#34;doiId&#34;:null,&#34;doiUrl&#34;:null,&#34;featured&#34;:false,&#34;firstPublished&#34;:{&#34;html&#34;:&#34;Jul 1, 2018 00:00:00 AM&#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;Jul 1, 2018 00:00:00 AM&#34;,&#34;value&#34;:&#34;2018-07-01T00:00:00.000-07:00&#34;},&#34;mlaCitation&#34;:&#34;Wise-Faberowski, Lisa et al. “Safety of Ferumoxytol in Children Undergoing Cardiac MRI under General Anaesthesia.” &lt;i>Cardiology in the young&lt;/i> 28.7 (2018): 916–21.

However, hypotension has been reported with the use of ferumoxytol for indications other than cardiac MRI. The purpose of our investigation was to evaluate the safety of ferumoxytol in children undergoing general anaesthesia for cardiac MRI.METHODS: Medical records of children undergoing general anaesthesia for cardiac MRI were reviewed. Baseline demographic and medical characteristics, as well as imaging and anaesthetic duration and technique, were collected. The incidence of hypotension or other adverse events&#39;, need for vasoactive support, or airway intervention throughout the anaesthetic, was recorded.RESULTS: A total of 95 patients were identified, 61 received ferumoxytol and 34 received gadolinium. There were no significant differences between groups with respect to age, weight, or baseline blood pressure. The incidence of low blood pressure - systolic or mean - after contrast administration did not differ between groups, and there was no difference in sustained hypotension or use of vasopressors between groups. One patient who received ferumoxytol had possible anaphylaxis. The image acquisition time (45 versus 68 min, p=0.002) and anaesthesia duration (100 versus 132 min, p=0.02) were shorter in the ferumoxytol group.CONCLUSION: Transient low blood pressure was common in children undergoing cardiac MRI with anaesthesia, but the incidence of hypotension did not differ between ferumoxytol and gadolinium groups.

A non-Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (nCPMG) SS-FSE acquisition stabilizes both the main and parasitic echo families for each echo. This preserves both the in-phase and quadrature components of the magnetization throughout the echo train. However, nCPMG SS-FSE also promotes aliasing of the quadrature component, which complicates reconstruction. A new acquisition and reconstruction approach is presented here, where the field-of-view is effectively doubled, but a partial k-space and variable density sampling is used to improve scan efficiency. The technique is presented in phantom scans to validate SNR and robustness against rapidly varying object phase. In vivo healthy volunteer examples and the clinical cases are demonstrated in abdominal imaging. This new approach provides comparable SNR to previous nCPMG acquisition techniques as well as providing more uniform apparent diffusion coefficient maps in phantom scans. In vivo scans suggest that this method is more robust against motion than previous approaches.

The proposed reconstruction is an improvement to the nCPMG sequence as it is auto-calibrating and is justified to accurately treat the signal model for the nCPMG SS-FSE sequence.\nDOI: 10.1109/TMI.2017.2741421, https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2017.2741421\nWeb of Science ID: 000419346900018, https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:ut/000419346900018\nPubMedID: 28829307, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28829307\nPubMedCentralID: PMC5784776, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5784776&#34;,&#34;value&#34;:null},&#34;doiId&#34;:&#34;10.1109/TMI.2017.2741421&#34;,&#34;doiUrl&#34;:&#34;https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2017.2741421&#34;,&#34;featured&#34;:false,&#34;firstPublished&#34;:{&#34;html&#34;:&#34;Jan 1, 2018 00:00:00 AM&#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;Jan 1, 2018 00:00:00 AM&#34;,&#34;value&#34;:&#34;2018-01-01T00:00:00.000-08:00&#34;},&#34;mlaCitation&#34;:&#34;Gibbons, Eric K. et al. “Robust Self-Carlibrating NCPMG Acquisition: Application to Body Diffusion-Weighted Imaging.” &lt;i>IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MEDICAL IMAGING&lt;/i> 37.1 (2018): 200–209.

A non-Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (nCPMG) SS-FSE acquisition stabilizes both the main and parasitic echo families for each echo. This preserves both the in-phase and quadrature components of the magnetization throughout the echo train. However, nCPMG SS-FSE also promotes aliasing of the quadrature component, which complicates reconstruction. A new acquisition and reconstruction approach is presented here, where the field-of-view is effectively doubled, but a partial k-space and variable density sampling is used to improve scan efficiency. The technique is presented in phantom scans to validate SNR and robustness against rapidly varying object phase. In vivo healthy volunteer examples and the clinical cases are demonstrated in abdominal imaging. This new approach provides comparable SNR to previous nCPMG acquisition techniques as well as providing more uniform apparent diffusion coefficient maps in phantom scans. In vivo scans suggest that this method is more robust against motion than previous approaches. The proposed reconstruction is an improvement to the nCPMG sequence as it is auto-calibrating and is justified to accurately treat the signal model for the nCPMG SS-FSE sequence.&#34;},{&#34;apaCitation&#34;:&#34;Ning, P., Shi, D., Sonn, G.

From UTE k-space data, three image sets were reconstructed: 1) one with all data, 2) one using the first 50% of data, and 3) a final set with soft-gating motion correction, leveraging the signal magnitude immediately after each excitation. Two radiologists in blinded fashion independently scored image quality of anatomical landmarks on a 5-point scale. Ratings were compared using Wilcoxon rank-sum, Wilcoxon signed-ranks, and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Interobserver agreement was assessed with the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).For fully sampled UTE, mean scores for all structures were ≥4 (good-excellent). Full UTE surpassed 4D flow for lungs and airways (P &lt; 0.001), with similar pulmonary artery (PA) quality (P = 0.62). 50% subsampling only slightly degraded all landmarks (P &lt; 0.001), as did motion correction.

With Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, 28 consecutive children referred for 3T knee MRI prospectively underwent a standard clinical knee protocol followed by T2 Sh. T2 Sh performance was assessed by two readers blinded to diagnostic reports.

Image quality was evaluated by rating anatomic delineation, with 95% confidence interval. A Wilcoxon rank-sum test assessed the null hypothesis that T2 Sh structure delineation compared to conventional 2D is unchanged. Intraclass correlation coefficients were calculated for interobserver agreement. Imaging time of the conventional protocol and T2 Sh was compared.There was 81% and 87% concordance between T2 Sh reports and diagnostic reports, respectively, for each reader. Upon consensus review, T2 Sh had 93% sensitivity and 100% specificity compared to clinical reports for detection of clinically relevant findings. The 95% confidence interval of diagnostic or better rating was 95-100%, with 34-80% interobserver agreement.

Medical records were reviewed for indication, any complications, if further diagnostic imaging was performed after MRI, and surgical findings. Two radiologists scored the images in two sessions on a 5-point scale for overall image quality and delineation of various anatomical structures. Confidence interval of proportions for likelihood of requiring additional diagnostic imaging after MRI was determined. For the possibility of reducing the protocol to a single rapid sequence, Wilcoxon-rank sum test was used to assess whether 4D flow and MRA significantly differed in anatomical delineation.One of 21 patients (4.8%, 80% confidence interval 0-11%) required additional imaging, a computed tomography angiography to assess lung parenchyma and peripheral pulmonary arteries. Only 1 of 13 patients (7.7%) with operative confirmation had a minor discrepancy between radiology and operative reports (80% confidence interval 0-17%). 4D flow was significantly superior to MRA (P &lt; 0.05) for the evaluation of systemic arteries, valves, ventricular trabeculae, and overall quality. Using Cohen&#39;s kappa coefficient, there was good interobserver agreement for the evaluation of systemic arteries by 4D flow (κ = 0.782), and systemic veins and pulmonary arteries by MRA (κ > 0.6). Overall 4D flow measurements (mean κ = 0.64-0.74) had better internal agreement compared with MRA (mean κ = 0.30-0.64).Ferumoxytol-enhanced cardiac MRI, without anesthesia, is feasible for the evaluation of complex CHD in neonates and young infants, with a low likelihood of need for additional diagnostic studies. The decreased risk by avoiding anesthesia must be balanced against the potential for adverse reactions with ferumoxytol.2 J. Magn. Reson.

Further, experiments with variable-flip-angle data showed that reducing view sharing improved accuracy in reconstruction and T1 mapping. In abdominal MRI, 2.3-fold and 3.6-fold reductions in temporal footprint allowed reduced motion artifacts.The complementary-Poisson-disc k-space sampling trajectory allowed a retrospective spatiotemporal resolution tradeoff using CS and view sharing, imparting robustness to motion and contrast enhancement.

A rapid focused Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) for appendicitis has been shown to have definitive sensitivity and specificity, similar to Computed tomography (CT) but without radiation and offers a potential alternative to US.In this single-center prospective cohort study, we sought to determine the difference in total length of stay and charges between rapid MRI and US as the initial imaging modality in pediatric and young adult patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) with suspected appendicitis. We hypothesized that rapid MRI would be more efficient and cost effective than US as the initial imaging modality in the ED diagnosis of appendicitis.A prospective randomized cohort study of consecutive patients was conducted in patients 2-30 years of age in an academic ED with access to both rapid MRI and US imaging modalities 24/7. Prior to the start of the study, the days of the week were randomized to either rapid MRI or US as the initial imaging modality. Physicians evaluated patients with suspected appendicitis per their usual manner. If the physician decided to obtain radiologic imaging, the pre-determined imaging modality for the day of the week was used. All decisions regarding other diagnostic testing and/or further imaging were left to the physician&#39;s discretion. Time intervals (min) between triage, order placement, start of imaging, end of imaging, image result and disposition (discharge vs. admission), as well as total charges (diagnostic testing, imaging and repeat ED visits) were recorded.Over a 100-day period, 82 patients were imaged to evaluate for appendicitis; 45/82 (55%) of patients were in the US first group; and 37/82 (45%) patients were in the rapid MRI first group. There were no differences in patient demographics or clinical characteristics between the groups and no cases of missed appendicitis in either group. 11/45 (24%) of US first patients had inconclusive studies, resulting in follow-up rapid MRI and 5 return ED visits contrasted with no inconclusive studies or return visits (p&lt; 0.05) in the rapid MRI group. The rapid MRI compared to US group was associated with longer ED length of stay (mean difference 100 min; 95% CI 35-169) and increased ED charges (mean difference $4,887; 95% CI $1,821 - $8,513).In the diagnosis of appendicitis, US first imaging is more time efficient and less costly than rapid MRI despite inconclusive studies after US imaging. Unless the process of obtaining a rapid MRI becomes more efficient and less expensive, US should be the first line imaging modality for appendicitis in patients 2-30 years of age.

Materials and Methods Institutional review board approval and informed consent were obtained. vrfSSFSE and conventional SSFSE sagittal and coronal oblique acquisitions were performed in 54 consecutive female patients referred for 3-T magnetic resonance (MR) evaluation of known or suspected uterine leiomyomas. Two radiologists who were blinded to the image acquisition technique semiquantitatively scored images on a scale from -2 to 2 for noise, image contrast, sharpness, artifacts, and perceived ability to evaluate uterine, ovarian, and musculoskeletal structures. The null hypothesis of no significant difference between pulse sequences was assessed with a Wilcoxon signed rank test by using a Holm-Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Results Because of reductions in specific absorption rate, vrfSSFSE imaging demonstrated significantly increased speed (more than twofold, P &lt; .0001), with mean repetition times compared with conventional SSFSE imaging decreasing from 1358 to 613 msec for sagittal acquisitions and from 1494 to 621 msec for coronal oblique acquisitions. Almost all assessed image quality and perceived diagnostic capability parameters were significantly improved with vrfSSFSE imaging. These improvements included noise, sharpness, and ability to evaluate the junctional zone, myometrium, and musculoskeletal structures for both sagittal acquisitions (mean values of 0.56, 0.63, 0.42, 0.56, and 0.80, respectively; all P values &lt; .0001) and coronal oblique acquisitions (mean values of 0.81, 1.09, 0.65, 0.93, and 1.12, respectively; all P values &lt; .0001).

Unlike EPI, SS-FSE is ill-suited to diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) due to the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Geill (CPMG) condition. Non- CPMG phase cycling does accommodate SS-FSE and DWI but places constraints on reconstruction, which are resolved here through parallel imaging. Additionally, improved echo stability can be achieved by using short duration and highly selective DIVERSE radiofrequency pulses. Here, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) comparisons between EPI and nCPMG SS-FSE acquisitions and reconstruction techniques give similar values. Diffusion imaging with nCPMG SS-FSE gives similar SNR to an EPI acquisition, though apparent diffusion coefficient values are higher than seen with EPI. In vivo images have good image quality with little distortion. This method has the ability to capture distortionfree DWI images near areas of significant off-resonance as well as preserve adequate SNR. Parallel imaging and DIVERSE refocusing RF pulses allow shorter ETL compared to previous implementations and thus reduces phase encode direction blur and SAR accumulation.&#34;},{&#34;apaCitation&#34;:&#34;Minamimoto, R., Iagaru, A., Jamali, M., Holley, D., Barkhodari, A., Vasanawala, S., &amp;amp; Zaharchuk, G.

GRPr proteins are highly overexpressed in several human tumors, including prostate cancer. We present data from the use of 68Ga-RM2 in patients with biochemical recurrence (BCR) of prostate cancer (PC) and negative conventional imaging (CI). Methods: We enrolled 32 men with BCR PC, 59-83 year-old (mean±standard deviation (SD): 68.7±6.4). Imaging started at 40-69 minutes (mean±SD: 50.5±6.8) after injection of 133.2-151.7 MBq (mean±SD: 140.6±7.4) of 68Ga-RM2 using a time-of-flight (TOF)-enabled simultaneous positron emission tomography (PET) / magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner. T1-weighted (T1w), T2-weighted (T2w) and diffusion-weighted images (DWI) were acquired. Results: All patients had rising prostate specific antigen (PSA) (range: 0.3-119.0 ng/mL; mean±SD: 10.1 ± 21.3) and negative CI (CT or MRI, and 99mTc MDP bone scan) prior to enrollment. The observed 68Ga-RM2 PET detection rate was 71.8%. 68Ga-RM2 PET identified recurrent prostate cancer in 23 of the 32 participants, while the simultaneous MRI scan identified findings compatible with recurrent prostate cancer in 11 of the 32 patients. PSA velocity (PSAv) values were 0.32±0.59 ng/ml/year (range: 0.04-1.9) in patients with negative PET scans and 2.51±2.16 ng/ml/year (range: 0.13-8.68) in patients with positive PET scans (P: 0.006). Conclusion:68Ga-RM2 PET can be used for assessment of GRPr expression in patients with BCR PC.

The proposed method was tested on six subjects and image quality was compared with standard accelerated Cartesian acquisition both with and without respiratory triggering. Inverse gradient entropy and normalized gradient squared metrics were calculated, testing whether image quality was improved using paired t-tests.For respiratory-triggered scans, wave-encoding significantly reduced residual aliasing and blurring compared with standard Cartesian acquisition (metrics suggesting P &lt; 0.05). For non-respiratory-triggered scans, the proposed method yielded significantly better motion correction compared with standard motion-corrected Cartesian acquisition (metrics suggesting P &lt; 0.01).The proposed methods can reduce motion artifacts and improve overall image quality of highly accelerated free-breathing abdominal MRI.

Inverse gradient entropy and normalized gradient squared metrics were calculated, testing whether image quality was improved using paired t-tests.For respiratory-triggered scans, wave-encoding significantly reduced residual aliasing and blurring compared with standard Cartesian acquisition (metrics suggesting P &lt; 0.05). For non-respiratory-triggered scans, the proposed method yielded significantly better motion correction compared with standard motion-corrected Cartesian acquisition (metrics suggesting P &lt; 0.01).The proposed methods can reduce motion artifacts and improve overall image quality of highly accelerated free-breathing abdominal MRI.

Medical records were reviewed for indication, any complications, if further diagnostic imaging was performed after MRI, and surgical findings. Two radiologists scored the images in two sessions on a 5-point scale for overall image quality and delineation of various anatomical structures. Confidence interval of proportions for likelihood of requiring additional diagnostic imaging after MRI was determined. For the possibility of reducing the protocol to a single rapid sequence, Wilcoxon-rank sum test was used to assess whether 4D flow and MRA significantly differed in anatomical delineation.One of 21 patients (4.8%, 80% confidence interval 0-11%) required additional imaging, a computed tomography angiography to assess lung parenchyma and peripheral pulmonary arteries. Only 1 of 13 patients (7.7%) with operative confirmation had a minor discrepancy between radiology and operative reports (80% confidence interval 0-17%). 4D flow was significantly superior to MRA (P &lt; 0.05) for the evaluation of systemic arteries, valves, ventricular trabeculae, and overall quality. Using Cohen&#39;s kappa coefficient, there was good interobserver agreement for the evaluation of systemic arteries by 4D flow (κ = 0.782), and systemic veins and pulmonary arteries by MRA (κ > 0.6). Overall 4D flow measurements (mean κ = 0.64-0.74) had better internal agreement compared with MRA (mean κ = 0.30-0.64).Ferumoxytol-enhanced cardiac MRI, without anesthesia, is feasible for the evaluation of complex CHD in neonates and young infants, with a low likelihood of need for additional diagnostic studies.

Sixty-eight percent of nondiagnostic US results occurred in overweight patients.Overweight and older patients are more likely to have a nondiagnostic US or appendicitis, and it may be more efficient to consider alternatives to US first for these patients. Also, this information about the accuracy of US to diagnose suspected appendicitis may be useful to clinicians who wish to engage in shared decision-making with the parents or guardians of children regarding imaging options for children with acute abdominal pain.&#34;},{&#34;apaCitation&#34;:&#34;Zhang, T., Grafendorfer, T., Cheng, J.

We present pilot data on the biodistribution of these PET tracers in a small cohort of patients with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer.Seven men (mean age ± SD, 74.3 ± 5.9 y) with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer underwent both(68)Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT and(68)Ga-RM2 PET/MRI scans. SUVmaxand SUVmeanwere recorded for normal tissues and areas of uptake outside the expected physiologic biodistribution.All patients had a rising level of prostate-specific antigen (mean ± SD, 13.5 ± 11.5) and noncontributory results on conventional imaging.(68)Ga-PSMA-11 had the highest physiologic uptake in the salivary glands and small bowel, with hepatobiliary and renal clearance noted, whereas(68)Ga-RM2 had the highest physiologic uptake in the pancreas, with renal clearance noted.

The blood pressure and heart rate of patients before and after ferumoxytol injection were compared. The overall image quality was evaluated independently by two radiologists with a four-point scale. Interobserver agreement was calculated using weighted kappa statistics.The mean±standard deviation (SD) pre and post-contrast systolic blood pressures (SBP) were 101±18 and 95±20, respectively. There was a statistically significant difference between pre-SBP and post-SBP (P=0.003). The pre-contrast diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and the post-contrast diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were 60±14 and 51±17, respectively. There was a statistically significant difference between pre-DBP and post-DBP (P&lt;0.001). The number of patients with SBP and DBP increase, SBP increase and DBP decrease, SBP decrease and DBP increase, SBP and DBP decrease, SBP increase and DBP unchanged were 14 (16%), 9 (10%), 6 (7%), 56 (65%), 1 (1%), respectively. There was moderate agreement on all individual assessments of image quality (kappa=0.45). Eighty-two of 86 (95.4%) studies were scored 3 or above (at least diagnostic quality) by both readers, with 90% confidence interval of 92-99%.Ferumoxytol is effective as an MR contrast agent.

(18)F-NaF/(18)F-FDG PET/CT and WBMRI were performed following BS. WBMRI protocol consisted of both non-contrast enhanced and contrast enhanced sequences. Lesions detected with each test were tabulated and the results were compared.For extra skeletal lesions, (18)F-/(18)F-FDG PET/CT and WBMRI had no statistically significant differences in sensitivity (92.9% vs 92.9%, P = 1.00), PPV (81.3% vs 86.7%, P = 0.68) and accuracy (76.5% vs 82.4%, P = 0.56).

With Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval/informed consent, patients referred for 3T abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were scanned with conventional SSFSE and either half-Fourier (n = 25) or full-Fourier vrfSSFSE (n = 50). Two blinded radiologists semiquantitatively scored images on a scale from -2 to 2 for contrast, noise, sharpness, artifacts, cardiac motion-related signal loss, and the ability to evaluate the pancreas and kidneys.vrfSSFSE demonstrated significantly increased speed (∼2-fold, P &lt; 0.0001). Significant improvements in image quality parameters with full-Fourier vrfSSFSE included increased contrast, sharpness, and visualization of pancreatic and renal structures with higher bandwidth technique (mean scores 0.37, 0.83, 0.62, and 0.31, respectively, P ≤ 0.001), and decreased image noise and improved visualization of renal structures when used with an equal bandwidth technique (mean scores 0.96 and 0.35, respectively, P &lt; 0.001). Increased cardiac motion-related signal loss with full-Fourier vrfSSFSE was seen in the pancreas but not the kidney.vrfSSFSE increases speed at 3T over conventional SSFSE via reduced SAR, and when combined with full-Fourier acquisition can improve image quality, although with some increased sensitivity to cardiac motion-related signal loss.

Fair to substantial interobserver agreement was reached on nine arteries.Free-breathing spatiotemporally accelerated 3-D time-resolved contrast-enhanced MR angiography frequently yields diagnostic image quality for most abdominal arteries in young children.&#34;},{&#34;apaCitation&#34;:&#34;Cheng, J.

Second, intrinsic multichannel butterfly navigators were used to measure respiratory motion. Lastly, these estimates are applied for both motion-weighted data-consistency in a compressed sensing and parallel imaging reconstruction, and for nonrigid motion correction using a localized autofocusing framework. With Institutional Review Board approval and informed consent/assent, studies were performed on 22 consecutive pediatric patients. Two radiologists independently scored the images for overall image quality, degree of motion artifacts, and sharpness of hepatic vessels and the diaphragm. The results were assessed using paired Wilcoxon test and weighted kappa coefficient for interobserver agreements.The complete procedure yielded significantly better overall image quality (mean score of 4.7 out of 5) when compared to using no correction (mean score of 3.4, P &lt; 0.05) and to using motion-weighted accelerated imaging (mean score of 3.9, P &lt; 0.05). With an average scan time of 28 seconds, the proposed method resulted in comparable image quality to conventional prospective respiratory-triggered acquisitions with an average scan time of 91 seconds (mean score of 4.5).With the proposed methods, diagnosable high-resolution abdominal volumetric scans can be obtained from free-breathing data acquisitions.

Medical records were reviewed for the clinical indication, ferumoxytol dose, injection rate, sedation and any complication. A two-reader consensus scored the images on a five-point scale for overall image quality and delineation of various anatomical structures. Signal-to-background ratios for abdominal aorta and inferior vena cava for abdominal cases and blood pool-myocardium contrast ratios for cardiac cases were calculated. The confidence intervals for obtaining a score of three or above for each image parameter were calculated by using adjusted Wald method.For abdominal MR angiography, average scores for overall image quality, as well as delineation of the hepatic artery, superior mesenteric artery, renal artery and veins were 4.5, 4.3, 4.3, 3.7 and 4.7, respectively. For cardiac exams, the average scores for overall image quality, systemic arteries, pulmonary arteries, pulmonary veins, valves and ventricles were 4.4, 4.6, 4.1, 4.8, 4.1 and 4.7, respectively. For all parameters, the lower bound for the proportion of cases to have a score of 3 or above was 65%.

With Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval and informed consent/assent, 23 consecutive pediatric patients were recruited for this study. Free-breathing DCE MRI with ∼1 mm(3) spatial resolution and a 6.5-sec frame rate was acquired on a 3T scanner. Undersampled data were reconstructed with a compressed sensing method without motion correction (FB-CS) and the proposed method (FB-LR). A follow-up respiratory-triggered acquisition (RT-CS) was performed as a reference standard. The reconstructed images were evaluated independently by two radiologists. Wilcoxon tests were performed to test the hypothesis that there was no significant difference between different reconstructions. Quantitative evaluation of contrast dynamics was also performed.The mean score of overall image quality of FB-LR was 4.0 on a 5-point scale, significantly better (P &lt; 0.05) than FB-CS reconstruction (mean score 2.9), and similar to RT-CS (mean score 4.1). FB-LR also matched the temporal fidelity of contrast dynamics with a root mean square error less than 5%.Fast 3D free-breathing DCE MRI with high scan efficiency and image quality similar to respiratory-triggered acquisition is feasible in a pediatric clinical setting.J.

Mainstay interventions including surgery and sclerotherapy are invasive and can result in local recurrence and complications.We sought to assess the effect of 20 weeks of oral sildenafil on reducing lymphatic malformation volume and symptoms in children.Seven children (4 boys, 3 girls; ages 13-85 months) with lymphatic malformations were given oral sildenafil for 20 weeks in this open-label study. The volume of the lymphatic malformation was calculated blindly using magnetic resonance imaging performed before and after 20 weeks of sildenafil. Lymphatic malformations were assessed clinically on weeks 4, 12, 20, and 32. Both the physician and parents evaluated the lymphatic malformation in comparison with baseline.Four subjects had a lymphatic malformation volume decrease (1.0%-31.7%). In 2 subjects, despite a lymphatic malformation volume increase (1.1%-3.7%), clinical improvement was noted while on sildenafil. One subject had a 29.6% increase in lymphatic malformation volume and no therapeutic response. Lymphatic malformations of all 6 subjects who experienced a therapeutic response on sildenafil softened and became easily compressible.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-seven patients were imaged with a conventional spoiled gradient echo acquisition and 48 with a high STR multiphase acquisition after the administration of gadoxetate. Arterial phase capture, image quality, and quality of fat suppression were qualitatively graded. Fourteen lesions in the conventional group and 28 in the high STR multiphase group were imaged, including 34 focal nodular hyperplasias. The ratio of lesion to parenchyma enhancement as well as relative hepatic artery enhancement were calculated. Chi-squared, Mann-Whitney U and student t-tests were used to compare differences. RESULTS: The high STR multiphase acquisition included the arterial phase more frequently than conventional acquisitions (P &lt; 0.001), with the arterial phase missed in 17% (95% CI of 4-28%) of patients with conventional acquisition compared with 2% (95% CI of 0-6%) with the high STR multiphase acquisition. There was no loss of image quality or degree of fat saturation. Additionally, there was increased relative intensity of the hepatic arteries (P &lt; 0.001) as well as lesion enhancement (P = 0.01).

However, background suppression is limited; inflow times are inflexible; labeling region is difficult to define when tagging arterial flow; and scan times are long. To overcome these limitations, we propose the use of multiple inversion recovery preparatory pulses combined with alternating pulse repetition time balanced steady-state free precession to produce renal angiograms. Multiple inversion recovery uses selective spatial saturation followed by four nonselective inversion recovery pulses to concurrently null a wide range of background $T_1$ species while allowing for adjustable inflow times; alternating pulse repetition time steady-state free precession maintains vessel contrast and provides added fat suppression. The high level of suppression enables imaging in three-dimensional as well as projective two-dimensional formats, the latter of which has a scan time as short as one heartbeat.

Acquiring diagnostic-quality MR images in the pediatric abdomen is challenging due to motion, inability to breath hold, varying patient size, and artifacts. Motion-compensation techniques (eg, respiratory gating, signal averaging, suppression of signal from moving tissue, swapping phase- and frequency-encoding directions, use of faster sequences with breath holding, parallel imaging, and radial k-space filling) can improve image quality. Each of these techniques is more suitable for use with certain sequences and acquisition planes and in specific situations and age groups. Different T1- and T2-weighted sequences work better in different age groups and with differing acquisition planes and have specific advantages and disadvantages. Dynamic imaging should be performed differently in younger children than in older children. In younger children, the sequence and the timing of dynamic phases need to be adjusted. Different sequences work better in smaller children and in older children because of differing breath-holding ability, breathing patterns, field of view, and use of sedation. Hence, specific protocols should be maintained for younger children and older children. Combining longer-higher-resolution sequences and faster-lower-resolution sequences helps acquire diagnostic-quality images in a reasonable time.&#34;},{&#34;apaCitation&#34;:&#34;Danial, C., Tichy, A., Tariq, U., Swetman, G.

The correction scheme was applied to free-breathing abdominal patient studies. In these scans, a reduction in artifacts from complex, nonrigid motion was observed.&#34;},{&#34;apaCitation&#34;:&#34;Hsiao, A., Lustig, M., Alley, M. T., Murphy, M. J., &amp;amp; Vasanawala, S. S.

We propose a CS objective function that minimizes cross-channel joint sparsity in the wavelet domain. Our reconstruction minimizes this objective via iterative soft-thresholding, and integrates naturally with iterative self-consistent parallel imaging (SPIRiT). Like many iterative magnetic resonance imaging reconstructions, l₁-SPIRiT&#39;s image quality comes at a high computational cost. Excessively long runtimes are a barrier to the clinical use of any reconstruction approach, and thus we discuss our approach to efficiently parallelizing l₁-SPIRiT and to achieving clinically-feasible runtimes. We present parallelizations of l₁-SPIRiT for both multi-GPU systems and multi-core CPUs, and discuss the software optimization and parallelization decisions made in our implementation. The performance of these alternatives depends on the processor architecture, the size of the image matrix, and the number of parallel imaging channels. Fundamentally, achieving fast runtime requires the correct trade-off between cache usage and parallelization overheads.

With custom software, flow and ventricular volumes may be extracted with comparable accuracy to SSFP and 2D phase contrast. Furthermore, cardiac outputs were more consistent by 4D phase contrast.&#34;},{&#34;apaCitation&#34;:&#34;Ghanouni, P., Walters, S. G., &amp;amp; Vasanawala, S. S. (2012).

A pseudorandom k-space undersampling pattern was incorporated into a three-dimensional (3D) gradient-echo sequence; aliasing then has an incoherent noiselike pattern rather than the usual coherent fold-over wrapping pattern. This k-space-sampling pattern was combined with a compressed sensing nonlinear reconstruction method that exploits the assumption of sparsity of medical images to permit reconstruction from undersampled k-space data and remove the noiselike aliasing. Thirty-four patients (15 female and 19 male patients; mean age, 8.1 years; range, 0-17 years) referred for cardiovascular, abdominal, and knee MR imaging were scanned with this 3D gradient-echo sequence at high acceleration factors. Obtained k-space data were reconstructed with both a traditional parallel imaging algorithm and the nonlinear method. Both sets of images were rated for image quality, radiologist preference, and delineation of specific structures by two radiologists. Wilcoxon and symmetry tests were performed to test the hypothesis that there was no significant difference in ratings for image quality, preference, and delineation of specific structures.Compressed sensing images were preferred more often, had significantly higher image quality ratings, and greater delineation of anatomic structures (P &lt; .001) than did images obtained with the traditional parallel reconstruction method.A combination of parallel imaging and compressed sensing is feasible in a clinical setting and may provide higher resolution and/or faster imaging, addressing the challenge of delineating anatomic structures in pediatric MR imaging.&#34;},{&#34;apaCitation&#34;:&#34;Yen, Y.-F., Le Roux, P., Mayer, D., King, R., Spielman, D., Tropp, J., … Hurd, R.

Despite these strengths, the clinical feasibility of balanced SSFP is still limited both by bright fat signal and by the signal voids that result from off-resonance effects such as field or susceptibility variations. A new method, dual-acquisition phase-sensitive SSFP, combines the signals from two standard balanced SSFP acquisitions to separate fat and water while simultaneously reducing the signal voids. The acquisitions are added in quadrature and then phase corrected using a simple algorithm before fat and water can be identified simply by the sign of the signal. This method is especially useful for applications at high field, where the RF power deposition, spatial resolution requirements and gradient strength limit the minimum repetition times. Finally, dual-acquisition phase-sensitive SSFP can be combined with other magnetization preparation schemes to produce specific image contrast in addition to separating fat and water signals.&lt;/p>\n  &lt;p class=\&#34;doi\&#34;>\n    &lt;span>View details for &lt;a href=\&#34;https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mri.2005.10.013\&#34;>DOI 10.1016/j.mri.2005.10.013&lt;/a>&lt;/span>\n  &lt;/p>\n  &lt;p class=\&#34;wos\&#34;>\n    &lt;span>View details for &lt;a href=\&#34;https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;amp;rft_id=info:ut/000235506400002\&#34;>Web of Science ID 000235506400002&lt;/a>&lt;/span>\n  &lt;/p>\n  &lt;p class=\&#34;pub-med\&#34;>\n    &lt;span>View details for &lt;a href=\&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16455400\&#34;>PubMedID 16455400&lt;/a>&lt;/span>\n  &lt;/p>&#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;Abstract:\nBalanced steady-state free precession (SSFP) sequences use fully re-focussed gradient waveforms to achieve a high signal and useful image contrast in short scan times.

The sum-of-squares SSFP technique (SOS-SSFP) delivers both robust banding artifact reduction and higher SNR efficiency than other multiple-acquisition techniques, while preserving SSFP contrast.\nDOI: 10.1002/mrm.20052, https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mrm.20052\nWeb of Science ID: 000221239000022, https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:ut/000221239000022\nPubMedID: 15122688, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15122688&#34;,&#34;value&#34;:null},&#34;doiId&#34;:&#34;10.1002/mrm.20052&#34;,&#34;doiUrl&#34;:&#34;https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mrm.20052&#34;,&#34;featured&#34;:false,&#34;firstPublished&#34;:{&#34;html&#34;:&#34;May 1, 2004 00:00:00 AM&#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;May 1, 2004 00:00:00 AM&#34;,&#34;value&#34;:&#34;2004-05-01T00:00:00.000-07:00&#34;},&#34;mlaCitation&#34;:&#34;Bangerter, N.

Several methods have been proposed to reduce SSFP banding artifact by combining multiple phase-cycled SSFP acquisitions, each differing in how individual signal magnitudes and phases are combined. These include maximum-intensity SSFP (MI-SSFP) and complex-sum SSFP (CS-SSFP). The reduction in SSFP banding is accompanied by a loss in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) efficiency. In this work a general framework for analyzing banding artifact reduction, contrast, and SNR of any multiple-acquisition SSFP combination method is presented. A new sum-of-squares method is proposed, and a comparison is performed between each of the combination schemes.

Although these sequences offer fast scanning with good signal-to-noise efficiency, the \&#34;transient response,\&#34; or time taken to reach a steady-state, can be long compared with the total imaging time, particularly when using 2D sequences. This results in lost imaging time and has made SSFP difficult to use for real-time and cardiac-gated applications. A linear-systems analysis of the steady-state and transient response for general periodic sequences is shown. The analysis is applied to refocused-SSFP sequences to generate a two-stage method of \&#34;catalyzing,\&#34; or speeding up the progression to steady-state by first scaling, then directing the magnetization. This catalyzing method is compared with previous methods in simulations and experimentally. Although the second stage of the method exhibits some sensitivity to B(1) variations, our results show that the transient time can be significantly reduced, allowing imaging in a shorter total scan time.

                    My primary focus is application of new MR imaging technology to musculoskeletal problems.  Current projects include: Rapid MRI for Osteoarthritis, Weight-bearing cartilage imaging with MRI, and MRI-based models of muscle.  We are studying the application of new MR imaging techniques such as rapid imaging, real-time imaging, and short echo time imaging to learn more about biomechanics and pathology of bones and joints.  I am also interested in functional imaging approaches using PET-MRI.

                    I am interested in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) applications and augmented reality applications in medicine.  These include abdominal, breast and musculoskeletal imaging, which require development of faster, quantitative, and more efficient MRI methods that provide improved diagnostic contrast compared with current methods. My work includes novel excitation schemes, efficient imaging methods and reconstruction tools and augmented reality in medicine.
