    Here are some things I’ve worked on.
        94 MHz RISC-V CPU
        Designed a pipelined processor in
          SystemVerilog
          for the RISC-V ISA
        Used P6 style renaming, an N-way superscalar design, early tag broadcast, early branch resolution, and GShare branch prediction.
        Also incorporated instruction prefetching, non-blocking instruction and data caches (N-way set-associative and banked, respectively), a victim cache, and a load-store queue with forwarding.
        Achieved a clock frequency of ~94MHz and an average CPI of 1.7 on a suite of programs including GNU libraries, Alexnet, sorting algorithms, and geometric functions.

        Roll Over Beethoven: A Cloth Piano
        A foldable, portable piano/keyboard.
        Comprises the core instrument with cloth keys (on foldable card paper), a graphics display (for feedback and tutorials), and a sustain pedal.
        Wrote drivers for the sensors and display, synthesized different timbres, and created a tutorial in
          C

        Formal Verification of FtTokenCMP
        Formally verified
          FtTokenCMP
          , a fault-tolerant, token-based cache coherence protocol using
            [Murphi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mur%CF%86)
        EECS 270 RTL DV Autograder
        As a TA, co-developed testing frameworks in
          Verilog
          , set up
          Docker
          environments, and wrote testbenches to verify student FPGA designs.
        Deployed on autograder.io, and used by every computer engineering student at Michigan (~300/semester).
        FPGA Design Projects
        Four function calculator, traffic lights controller, and carry lookahead adder.
        Deployed and verified on
          Altera DE2-115
          boards.
        Robotic Planning and Controls Projects
        iLQR implementation in
          Pytorch
          for the inverted double-pendulum on a cart.
        MPC and MPPI for linearizing cartpole and robot arm dynamics.
        Dynamics from state measurements, with Gaussian processes.
        Misc C/C++ Projects
        RISC-V assembler, simulator, linker
        Pipeline and cache simulators in C
        Tarjan’s pairing heap
        SQL-like relational database
        Among Us simulator with optimal TSP
        Seam-carving for image resizing
