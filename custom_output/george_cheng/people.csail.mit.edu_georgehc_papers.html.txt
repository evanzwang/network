        Theory for analyzing social data and medical images
        To forecast whether a news topic will go viral on Twitter, we can
            compare it to past news topics with similar Tweet activity. More
            generally, we can make a prediction based on an observation by
            looking at similar past observations. I've analyzed when, why, and
            how well some of these methods work:

        Real-time medical image analysis
        Various real-time medical imaging applications could be enabled by speeding up
            dimensionality reduction, a subroutine used in many image analysis algorithms.
            To do this, we create a sparse description of a manifold; our work relates to
            sparse multivariate regression:

        Modeling brain activation patterns
        My master's thesis presented a probabilistic model of brain
            activation patterns evoked by functional stimuli such as reading
            sentences; the model combines sparse coding and image alignment:

        Backpack with sensors for indoor modeling
        I developed algorithms that track where this fancy backpack is
            indoors using laser scanners.
          After I graduated from Berkeley, this project progressed quite a bit!
