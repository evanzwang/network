                  Introducing Our Graduate Writing Consultants
                  By Sabrina Soracco
                      Thanks to generous funding provided by the Chancellorâ€™s Advisory Committee on Student Services and Fees (CACSSF) and to Vice Provost and Graduate Dean Lisa GarcÃ­a Bedolla, the
                      is pleased to have three Graduate Writing Consultants on its staff.
                      Graduate Writing Consultants assist with the development of online resources, facilitate writing groups, and are available for
                        one-on-one consultations
                      with UC Berkeley graduate students. (These consultations are distinct from the
                        professional development consultations
                      , which are also available to graduate students through
                        GradPro
                      .)
                      We invite you to make use of this wonderful writing resource. To schedule a one-on-one consultation with a Graduate Writing Consultant,
                        please use this form.
                              Michael Arjun Banerjee
                                I am a third-year doctoral student in Jurisprudence and Social Policy, studying American legal history.Â I have been working as a Graduate Writing Consultant since January 2020, with an emphasis on academic writing.Â Before coming to Berkeley, I earned a J.D. from Harvard Law School. At Harvard, I served as a Student Attorney with the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau and the Harvard Defenders, and also as Editor-in-Chief of theÂ Harvard BlackLetter Law Journal.
                              Ruth Rouvier (she/her)
                                I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Linguistics. I am broadly interested in the relationship between language, identity, and well-being in indigenous and minoritized language communities, and my dissertation examines the role of emotions and motivation in language reclamation and revitalization. Iâ€™ve taught writing at UC Berkeley, UC Davis, and the University of Michigan, and at the high school level. Iâ€™ve also worked for federal and tribal governments and non-profit organizations, and have a background in grant writing and a particular interest in writing for multidisciplinary and nonacademic audiences.
                              Caitlin Scholl (she/her)
                                I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Comparative Literature. After receiving a B.A. in English from Reed College, I worked in the nonprofit sector for several years. Since coming to Berkeley, I have taught writing courses both on campus and at San Quentin State Prison through the Prison University Project. Currently, I am at work on a dissertation that focuses on literary and cinematic genre in the aftermath of austerity in several African countries, including Morocco, where I conducted research on a Fulbright grant.
