                          How we measure 'reads'
                        A 'read' is counted each time someone views a publication summary (such as the title, abstract, and list of authors), clicks on a figure, or views or downloads the full-text.

                            In this study, a new implicit forcing immersed boundary (IFIB) method is proposed to solve incompressible viscous fluid flow problems involving complex domains. In the conventional immersed boundary (IB) method, a forcing term computed from the volume of solid (VOS) is added to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in order to satisfy the velo...

                            For wave exciting load on offshore structures, Froude-Kyrlov (FK) force is easier to evaluate than diffracting force. But current nonlinear FK models suffer low computational speed. Conventionally, FK force is calculated by performing Gaussian quadrature (GQ) on each surface mesh and the choice of the mesh size is important in order to resolve wave...

                            In this article, the high-order upwinding combined compact difference scheme developed in a three-point grid stencil is applied to solve the incompressible Navier-Stokes (NS) and energy equations in three dimensions. The time integrator with symplectic property is employed to approximate the temporal derivative term in inviscid Euler equation so as...

                            In this study, a GPU-accelerated improved mixed Lagrangian–Eulerian (IMLE) method is proposed to solve the three-dimensional incompressible Navier–Stokes equations. To improve the prediction accuracy, the proposed IMLE method approximates the total derivative term in Lagragian sense, and the spatial derivative terms are approximated on Eulerian coo...

                            In this study, a new high-order particle method is proposed to solve the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations. The proposed method combines the advantages of particle and mesh methods to approximate the total and the spatial derivative terms under the Lagrangian and the Eulerian frameworks. Our aim is to avoid convective instability and increase...

                            In the community of computational fluid dynamics, pressure Poisson equation with Neumann boundary condition is usually encountered when solving the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations in a segregated approach such as SIMPLE, PISO, and projection methods. To deal with Neumann boundary conditions more naturally and to retain high order spatial acc...

                            Owing to the fact that the Poisson equation of pressure for incompressible fluid flow is purely elliptic, it is therefore computationally improper to compute pressure on irregularly distributed moving particles as addressed in the recent Moving Particle with embedded Pressure Mesh (MPPM) method. In the current work, a modified MPPM method known as...
