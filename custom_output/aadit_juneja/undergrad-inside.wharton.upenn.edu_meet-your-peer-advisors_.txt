                              What are your career interests and where have you interned/worked over your summers?
                              My career interest are in the intersection of the following industries: healthcare, operations, social impact, and education.
                            First-year Summer: Administrative Assistant at a primary care clinic (healthcare) and a Brand Ambassador at Intern Queen
                            Second-year Summer: Healthcare Operations & Improvement intern at Exact Sciences
                            Third-year Summer: Healthcare & Life Sciences Summer Associate Consultant at Simon-Kucher
                              What is the biggest challenge you’ve faced at Wharton/Penn?
                              Not following the herd. It is very easy to pick the most traveled path when it comes to recruiting and picking a career. However, it is always best to follow your own passions and interests, even if it is not the status quo. It took me a while, but I was able to address this tendency of following the herd and overcome it.
                              Why should a student see a peer advisor?
                              We have been in your shoes, so we will usually know the best way to help you. Additionally, we are there to help answer the questions that you might not want to or cannot ask your academic advisor.
                              What is one thing that a new student should learn more about?
                              Coffee chats & lunches with professors and teaching staff. They are great resources and offer great advice.
                              Fun fact(s) about you

                              Having a strong sense of self whether it’s career wise or personal values. It’s easy to get caught up with what everyone else is saying or doing but that doesn’t mean you have to follow.

                              Why should a first-year student see a peer advisor, and what should they ask a peer advisor about?
                              It’s always good to ask people who have been in similar situations to you. I wish I had reached out to upperclassmen and had gotten advice earlier.

                              Learning how to not to get caught up with all the overwhelming pressure regarding clubs, recruiting, and college life, especially as a freshman, and working towards what is best for me and my interests.
                              Career Services is a great resource on campus that is often overlooked by students. You can schedule as many meeting as you need with an advisor to work through your resume, cover letters, and interview prep.
