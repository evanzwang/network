                                    Detailed Statement of Research Interests
                                      The early focus of my research was classical Japanese literature, especially waka poetics and medieval literature related to
                                      The Tale of the Heike
                                      and its variants. More recent research has focused on music in medieval Japanese literature, mythology, and literature and the environment. In my research and teaching, I try to bring Japanese literature into dialogue with other literatures and disciplinary perspectives.
