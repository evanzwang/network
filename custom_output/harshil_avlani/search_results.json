    "snippet": "Harshil Avlani studied the arrangement of qubits (units of information) located in quantum computers, hoping to reduce significant errors. He concluded that some quantum simulators used today do not account for the significant errors that he measured. Harshil's research suggested that efficacy was increased after relocating the \"spectator qubits\" farther away from a certain quantum gate."
