                            Evaluation of OpenAI's GPT models, Google-internal dense transformer architectures, and Switch-style sparse transformers on BIG-bench, across model sizes spanning millions to hundreds of billions of parameters finds that model performance and calibration both improve with scale, but are poor in absolute terms.

                            This work presents ACUE-VAL, a metric that leverages the power of LLMs to perform two sub-tasks: decomposing summaries into atomic content units (ACUs) and validating them against the source document, and shows reduced preference bias towards LLM-generated sum-mary.
