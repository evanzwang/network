<h2 id="about">About</h2>
<p>I am a San Francisco based Machine Learning Researcher and Engineer, currently working on delivering cyber-risk analytics to the global cyber-insurance market. I work with terabyte-scale data to develop models using Deep Learning and Matrix Factorization techniques.</p>

<p>I particularly enjoy working with language data and models, and I have set up this blog to document personal research projects. If you have any questions or comments about any of my <a href="http://trishalaneeraj.github.io/">blog posts</a> here or my work in general, please feel free to email me at tn338 [at] cornell [dot] edu. You can also find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/trishalaneeraj/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/trishalaneeraj">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=X2lSWUQAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;authuser=1&amp;sortby=pubdate">Google Scholar</a>.</p>

<h2 id="education">Education</h2>
<p>I focused on Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing during my graduate studies and research at Cornell University. During this time, I also had the opportunity to learn about <a href="https://tech.cornell.edu/news/video-tech-with-a-purpose/">product development</a> and work actively with <a href="https://medium.com/p/66120ec11854#f79f">community-based</a> as well as <a href="https://tech.cornell.edu/news/product-challenge-google-cio/">big tech</a> organizations in New York City. My experiences taught me to think deeply about the sustainability of technological solutions and their human and social impact.</p>

<p>I obtained a Bachelor of Engineering degree from BITS Pilani, India. I also spent some time at the Predictive Technology Lab at University of Virginia as a visiting research scholar. I worked on projects designed and developed for research in public health.</p>
