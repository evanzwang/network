                              How can technology entrepreneurs build competitive advantage from the ground up? Professor Andy Wu conducts scholarly research and develops course materials that document how technology entrepreneurs can (1) organize for innovation to create new market opportunities and (2) mobilize resources to achieve scale. These two considerations distinguish entrepreneurial strategy from incumbent strategy in technology. To intimately understand the practice and consequences of these actions for technology entrepreneurs, Professor Wu uses a variety of empirical methods: archival data, field experiments, laboratory experiments, and qualitative interviews.
