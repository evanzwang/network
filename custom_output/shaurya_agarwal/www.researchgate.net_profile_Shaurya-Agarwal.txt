                            This research contributes to the advancement of traffic state estimation and prediction methodologies by leveraging the benefits of the nonlocal LWR model within a physics-informed deep learning (PIDL) framework. The classical LWR model, while useful, falls short of accurately representing real-world traffic flows due to the assumption that traffic...

                            This paper introduces a novel approach employing extreme value theory to analyze queue lengths within a corridor controlled by adaptive controllers. We consider the maximum queue lengths of a signalized corridor consisting of nine intersections every two minutes, roughly equivalent to the cycle length. Our research shows that maximum queue lengths...

                            Self-similarity, a fractal characteristic of traffic flow dynamics, is widely recognized in transportation engineering and physics. However, its practical application in real-world traffic scenarios remains limited. Conversely, the traffic flow dynamics at adaptive signalized intersections still need to be fully understood. This paper addresses thi...

                            The analysis of a timeseries can provide many new perspectives if it is accompanied by the assumption that the timeseries is generated from an underlying dynamical system. For example, statistical properties of the data can be related to measure theoretic aspects of the dynamics, and one can try to recreate the dynamics itself. The underlying dynam...

                            Quasiperiodically driven dynamical systems are nonlinear systems which are driven by some periodic source with multiple base-frequencies. Such systems abound in nature, and are present in data collected from sources such as astronomy and traffic data. We present a completely data-driven procedure which reconstructs the dynamics into two components...

                            Nonlocal calculus-based macroscopic traffic models overcome the limitations of classical local models in accurately capturing traffic flow dynamics. These models incorporate “nonlocal” elements by considering the speed as a weighted mean of downstream traffic density, aligning it more closely with realistic driving behaviors. The primary contributi...
