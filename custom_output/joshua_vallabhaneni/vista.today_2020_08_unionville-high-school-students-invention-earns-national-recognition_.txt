                      Pranavh Joshua Vallabhaneni, a rising sophomore at Unionville High School, has earned national recognition for his award-winning invention, a hot-car-alert device called Baby Saver,
                        [writes Marc Narducci for](https://www.inquirer.com/life/pranavh-joshua-vallabhaneni-invented-baby-saver-hot-car-alert-device-20200819.html)
                          The
                          Philadelphia Inquirer
                        .
                      When Vallabhaneni started hearing tragic stories about babies dying in overheated cars four years ago, he immediately began thinking of ways to prevent this from happening.
                      “The most tragic part is that over 50 percent of hot-car child deaths have happened because of parents forgetting their children in cars,” he said. “Forgetting can happen to anyone. I couldn’t imagine a tragedy like this happening in my family.”
                      So he started experimenting on a device that sends automated alerts to parents and local authorities as the temperature inside a vehicle crosses certain thresholds.
                      The invention earned him a spot in the Invention Convention Nationals, where he won first place among ninth-grade competitors and first place for safety. He received the two awards during the 2020 Virtual Awards Ceremony in July.
                      “To get recognized is an honor,” he said. “I am really grateful to have an opportunity to showcase my invention on a national level.”
