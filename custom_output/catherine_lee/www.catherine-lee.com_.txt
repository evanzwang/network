            What They Say
                Catherine is a phenomenal designer and wonderful team member. She is incredibly methodical in her work, and rigorous about using both data and qualitative user research to inform her designs. She produces incredibly thoughtful work quickly, and handles feedback very well from team members. Communication and presentation of her ideas is a core strength of hers, she is great at building a consensus around a direction. She is an absolute pleasure to work with and any team would be very lucky to have her.
