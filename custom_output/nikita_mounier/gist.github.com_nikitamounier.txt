                                In Computer Science class I was tasked with writing a function takes a raw CSV table and returns a list of OrderedDictionaries and vice versa – but in Python.
                                It felt messy, convoluted and slow, so I wanted to what it would look like in Swift, especially with Pointfree's swift-parsing library and their experimental parser-builder branch.
                                This is as high performance as possible while using the swift-parsing library. Consequently, this doesn't support special characters such as é or æ due to the use of UTF8 code units.
