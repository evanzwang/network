              Gilles Pirio has filed for patents to protect the following inventions. This listing includes patent applications that are pending as well as patents that have already been granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).
                    [Entity resolution techniques and systems](/patent/9734207)
                    Patent number:
                    9734207
                    Abstract:
                    Entity resolution techniques and systems are described. An entity resolution method may include estimating a joint probability of occurrence of a plurality of values of a respective plurality of descriptors of an entity. The plurality of descriptor values may be included in a first data set. The method may further include determining that the joint probability of occurrence of the plurality of descriptor values is less than a threshold probability, identifying a second data set including the same plurality of values of the same respective plurality of descriptors, and determining, based at least in part on the joint probability of occurrence of the plurality of descriptor values being less than the threshold probability and on the first and second data sets including the same plurality of descriptor values, that the first and second data sets describe the same entity.

                    [Process for the localized growth of nanotubes and process for fabricating a self-aligned cathode using the nanotube growth process](/patent/7214553)
                    7214553
                    The invention relates to a process for the controlled growth of nanotubes or nanofibers on a substrate, characterized in that it furthermore comprises the production, on the substrate (11), of a bi-layer structure composed of a layer of catalyst material (71), for catalyzing the growth of nanotubes or nanofibers, and a layer of associated material, said associated material being such that it forms a noncatalytic alloy with the catalyst material at high temperature. The invention also relates to a process for fabricating a field-emission cathode using the above nanotube or nanofiber fabrication process. These processes allow very precise positioning of the catalyst spots from which the nanotubes and nanofibers can be grown and allow the fabrication of cathodes for which the nanotubes or nanofibers are self-aligned with the aperture in the extraction grid. Applications: electron tubes, nanolithography.
