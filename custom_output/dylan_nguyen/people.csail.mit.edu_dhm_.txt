          I am the Bonnie and Marty (1964) Tenenbaum Career Development Assistant
                Professor of EECS at MIT. I run the
            [Algorithmic Alignment
                Group](http://algorithmicalignment.csail.mit.edu)
            in the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and I'm also a
                Schmidt Sciences AI2050 Early Career Fellow. My research develops
                methods to ensure that AI systems behavior aligns with the goals and
                values of their human users and society as a whole, a concept known as
                'AI alignment'. My group and I work to address alignment challenges in
                multi-agent systems, human-AI teams, and societal oversight of machine
                learning. Our goal is to enable the safe, beneficial, and trustworthy
                deployment of AI in real-world settings.

          How to Express Interest
          Please do not email me directly. I can't reliably
                respond in a fair way. Instead, please fill out
                our
            [prospective
                student interest form](https://forms.gle/bpN9pJ8TpbopPe7v9)
            . This help will help me
                efficiently review all inquiries and ensure I don't
                miss anyone during the official application
                review.
          Meeting Requests
          Due to the high volume of inquiries, I typically
                cannot meet with prospective students outside the
                standard admissions process.
          Diversity and Inclusion
          I am committed to building a diverse and inclusive
                research group. I strongly encourage applications from
                students of all backgrounds, particularly those from
                underrepresented groups in STEM.
