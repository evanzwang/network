              [What We Do](/what-we-do)
            We left the UAE to work deeply with Generative AI in the heart of Silicon Valley, even before the release of ChatGPT. We worked with and built a team of people on the cutting edge, driving forward AI innovation.
            We want to bring this innovation back home to the UAE to turbocharge the economy.
