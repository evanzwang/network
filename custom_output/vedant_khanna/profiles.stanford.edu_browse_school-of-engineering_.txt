                          Bio
                          I am currently a Ph.D. student of the The Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering (ICME) at Stanford university. Prior to joining Stanford, I obtained my bachelor degree in computational mathematics at the School of Mathematical Sciences, Peking University, fortunately having Prof. Liwei Wang as my research advisor. My research is highly interdisciplinary across machine learning, statistics, operations research. While primarily focusing on theoretical aspects, the ultimate goal of my research is to develop state-of-the-art solutions for important real-world problems.
