        What's good! I'm a 19-year-old EECS student @ MIT into AI, startups, VC, and PM. Currently freelancing.
        My interests extend to fintech (payments, wealth management, AI analysts), robotics (collaboration and control), healthtech (LLM-aided care), and productivity tools. I am a big proponent of "automating the mundane" and believe BS jobs should be automated away and cut out. By doing so I believe significantly more attention can be redirected towards the things that require human ingenuity. I also think people should be able to easily access unfiltered and sentiently-processed information and ideas.
        Previously worked on:
            [Cardiac imaging interpretability](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/circ.148.suppl_1.12897)
            [Analyzing teamwork synergy](https://bit.ly/4974Bbi)
            [Smarter irrigation and water management](https://southsideplacecommunitygarden.org/?p=1431)
        Also worked on robot motion planning and control @ Rice RobotPI, built real robots and algorithms for VEX World Championships, and am a retired USAJMO winner and USACO Gold Medalist.
        On the side I love tennis, basketball, football, biking, the outdoors, conventional rap and Dude Perfect hype music, Saturday Night Live, and other random funny media sources.
        I'm always open to new ideas and projects. Please don't hesitate to reach out!
