                                My research examines the global iterations of the Cold War with an emphasis on twentieth- and twenty-first-century South Asia. Working across literature, media, and political history, I am interested in how Cold War frameworks collide with the aftermaths of decolonization through figures of time, economy, and emergency, amongst others. At Brown, I’ve held fellowships from the Cogut Institute for the Humanities and the Center for Contemporary South Asia. I was previously an editorial fellow at
