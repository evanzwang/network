                  THE YOUNGEST A 7 YEAR OLD
                The Masason Foundation (“the Foundation,” President: Masayoshi Son) has chosen 34 people  as members of the Foundation (Generation 6). They will be given support as associate members* starting July 1, 2022.
                Members chosen include an 8 year old who earned the Guinness world record title for the “Youngest Computer Programmer” at the age of 6, a 12 year old aiming to achieve the practical application of a fully artificial heart, and an 18 year old who developed a novel biodegradable plastic based on bacillus natto and established a way to stably produce it at the age of 15. Associate members certified last year (Generation 5) who passed the screening process were also certified as authorized members.
                ■About Members (Planned to be as of July 1, 2022)
                  *The Foundation will certify talented persons as associate members for the initial year, and a decision will be made as to whether they will be confirmed as authorized members based on their activities and achievements during that year. Associate members will also receive support from the Foundation such as financial support, the free use of facilities for members, and be able to participate in events organized by the Foundation. The period of validity will be determined on a case-by-case basis after taking into account the completion date of the individual’s educational process. However, if an authorized member reaches 29 years of age, the period of validity will end on the last day of the first fiscal year after that point. In addition, if an authorized Foundation member is 23 years old or younger at the end of the validity period and wishes to extend, the validity period may be extended after re-screening.
                The Foundation asked six of the members for their thoughts. Their self-introductions will also be posted on the Foundation’s website(
