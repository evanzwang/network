                          Current Research and Scholarly Interests
                          My primary research interests lie at the intersection of algorithms, learning, applied probability, and statistics.   I am particularly interested in understanding the algorithmic and information theoretic possibilities and limitations for many fundamental information extraction tasks that underly real-world machine learning and data-centric applications.
