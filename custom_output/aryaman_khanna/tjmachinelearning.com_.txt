      We are a group of students from Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology who are
                interested in machine learning. In our beginner series, we provide fun and engaging lectures and
                competitions that introduce machine learning concepts. In our advanced series, we supplement and go
                beyond the content taught in the TJ ML Class.
      TJHSST Machine Learning Club aims to bring the complex and vast topic of machine learning to high school
                students. We teach a variety of topics, including SVMs, Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks,
                Recurrent Neural Networks, and more.
      We hold challenges every week to supplement the topics we cover in the lectures. Every so often, we have
                larger competitions, where everyone competes to produce the best solution
                to solve real world challenges using actual data. TJHSST Machine Learning also strongly encourages
                students to take part in external competitions to improve their knowledge.
