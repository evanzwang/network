          Hi, my name is Ryan Lin, an undergraduate student at the California Institute of Technology. I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science, with a keen focus on machine learning.
          My journey in academia has brought me to my role as an undergraduate researcher at the Anima AI + Science Lab. Equipped with the knowledge I gained from various graduate-level machine learning courses, I hope to delve deeper into the complex concepts and techniques related to artificial intelligence.
          In the industry, I have spent three summers full-time as a full-stack developer and a DevSecOps engineer at the MITRE Corporation, where I honed my skills in software engineering and learned about industry practices and methodologies. I also worked with MITRE during the school year as a part-time employee. Moreover, in summer of 2024, I joined MITRE part-time as a machine learning and software engineering intern.
          Beyond academics and professional pursuits, I am a part of the Caltech NCAA Division III Swimming & Diving team. Go Beavers!
