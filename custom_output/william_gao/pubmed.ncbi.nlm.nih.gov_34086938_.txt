          Many non-coding RNAs with known functions are structurally conserved: their intramolecular secondary and tertiary interactions are maintained across evolutionary time. Consequently, the presence of conserved structure in multiple sequence alignments can be used to identify candidate functional non-coding RNAs. Here, we present a bioinformatics method that couples iterative homology search with covariation analysis to assess whether a genomic region has evidence of conserved RNA structure. We used this method to examine all unannotated regions of five well-studied fungal genomes (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida albicans, Neurospora crassa, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe). We identified 17 novel structurally conserved non-coding RNA candidates, which include four H/ACA box small nucleolar RNAs, four intergenic RNAs and nine RNA structures located within the introns and untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs. For the two structures in the 3' UTRs of the metabolic genes GLY1 and MET13, we performed experiments that provide evidence against them being eukaryotic riboswitches.

              Phylogenetic distribution of the 1371 fungal genomes in the database. These genomes are all within the fungal phylum Ascomycota, which has been much more well-studied than the other major fungal phylum Basidiomycota. Ascomycota has three subphyla: Saccharomycotina, Pezizomycotina, and Taphrinomycotina. The taxonomy of all 1371 species was determined using the NCBI Taxonomy Browser. Per the legend, the font size and color reflect the taxonomic rank of each group listed in the phylogenetic tree. The number of genomes in each clade is listed after its name. In some cases, the sum of the number of genomes in lower levels does not equal the total number of genomes in a higher taxonomic level. This is because some genomes have been classified as ‘
                incertae sedis
                ,’ or of unknown taxonomic placement.

              Description of the method: the flanked and unflanked modes. Our structural non-coding RNA finding method has two modes: an unflanked mode for finding standalone structural non-coding RNA genes and a coding sequence-flanked mode. In the flanked mode, sequences annotated as introns and UTRs are flanked by adjacent coding sequences (CDSes) in the first homology search. Then, the non-coding portion of the produced alignment is extracted and all sequences with at least 50 nucleotides in this region are used to build an HMM that serves as the query for the subsequent homology search. We used the unflanked mode to screen all intergenic regions (IGRs) for standalone structural ncRNA genes and the flanked mode to screen all introns and UTRs for structures located in the non-coding regions of mRNAs.

                ) is consistently found in the intron of a vacuolar sorting protein. For each structure, the H box (ANANNA) and ACA box (ACA) motifs are highlighted in yellow and labeled. Nucleotides are colored according to degree of conservation per the legend. Base pairs highlighted in green are statistically significantly covarying. Putative interactions between the guide regions of the H/ACA snoRNAs and rRNAs are illustrated in blue, with the proposed site of pseudouridylation designated as ψ. R-scape uses R2R to draw the structures (43). The sequences have been trimmed to highlight the region of covariation. Positions with more than 50% gaps are not displayed unless they are base paired.

              Four conserved intergenic structural non-coding RNA candidates. These intergenic structures are found in different genomic contexts across genomes with high quality annotations, so we hypothesize that they are standalone non-coding RNA genes. Intergenic structures 1, 3 and 4 have some but not all of the signatures associated to H/ACA snoRNAs. Refer to the legend from Figure 3 for this and subsequent figures.

              Three mRNA structures likely to engage in autoregulation. We discovered 3 non-coding RNA structures associated with protein-coding genes that are likely to interact with the proteins produced from their mRNAs to autoregulate their translation. These include: (
                ) a 5′ UTR structure located in the
                RPL12
                gene encoding a ribosomal protein, (

                RPS13
                gene which also encodes a ribosomal protein and (
                ) a structure located in either the 5′ UTR or intron of a gene encoding lysyl-tRNA synthetase.

              Two eukaryotic 3′ UTR structures. Two structures were found in metabolic genes, which led to us hypothesize that they were eukaryotic riboswitches. These are (
