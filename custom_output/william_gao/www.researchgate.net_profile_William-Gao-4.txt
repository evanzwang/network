                          How we measure 'reads'
                        A 'read' is counted each time someone views a publication summary (such as the title, abstract, and list of authors), clicks on a figure, or views or downloads the full-text.

Beta vulgaris mitovirus 1 (BevuMV1) is an example first discovered in sugar beet cultivars. For the current study, complete coding sequences of 42 BevuMV1 strains were newly determined, deri...
