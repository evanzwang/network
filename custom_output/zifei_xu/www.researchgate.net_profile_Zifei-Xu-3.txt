                            Vertical axis wind turbines are receiving renewed attention due to the challenges faced by horizontal axis wind turbines in recent years. To achieve commercial applications, a key aspect is to improve the relatively low power coefficient of vertical axis wind turbines. Among several factors that affects output efficiency, the three-dimensional tip...

                            The stability and health condition of mooring system in a floating offshore wind turbine determine its operating life and power generalization efficiency. Suitable SHM method can ensure safe and stable operation of a FOWT. A tendon damage detect model in a data-driven way is developed in this paper and benefits from the advantages of variational mo...

                            This paper presents the simulation of offshore wind turbines (OWTs) suffering from turbulent wind and ice-induced vibrations (IIVs). To ascertain the effectiveness of IIVs, the fully coupled simulation of the NREL 5 MW OWT is implemented. The OWT model, which is processed as a multibody system, takes the aerodynamic load and the IIV simultaneously....

                            The support structure stability is the fundamental guarantee for the operation safety of offshore wind turbines. A NREL 5 MW wind turbine was selected as the baseline turbine and the ice loads were estimated by using the Ralston theory and considering the turbulent wind. The dynamic behaviors of the wind turbine tower installed with a cone structur...

                            To reduce the ice damage to the structure of an offshore wind turbine, an ice breading cone was installed at the boundary between wind turbine and sea level. Based on Matlock and Ralston methods, a calculation model was established for the collision load between the ice and the tower base, and subsequently a dynamic simulation model was set up for...

                            The offshore wind turbines (OWTs) constructed at the northern sea areas under cold climate are frequently subjected to floating ice loads. It is imperative to reduce the damage owing to the floating ice with some appropriate approaches. The purpose of this paper is to ascertain the effectiveness of the tuned mass damper (TMD) and the ice-breaking c...
