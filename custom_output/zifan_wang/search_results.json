We will finish the proof that the functor \ud835\udc9c is represented by a smooth quasiprojective scheme. Then, we review Grothendieck and Messing's theorem on deformations of abelian schemes. Finally, we will give an adelic description of \ud835\udc9c and define Hecke ..."

Our certification is based on the global Lipschitz constant of the network and the ..."
