                            Tin (Sn)‐based perovskites have made notable advances with external quantum efficiency of over 20%, but still exhibit low electroluminescence brightness insufficient for outdoor displays. Here, it is demonstrated that compact phenethylammonium tin iodide (PEA 2 SnI 4 ) films with an intact crystal structure can offer high luminance by optimizing th...

                            We investigate an electron transport bilayer fabricated at <110 °C to form all low-temperature processed, thermally stable, efficient perovskite solar cells with negligible hysteresis. The components of the bilayer create a symbiosis that results in improved devices compared with either of the components being used in isolation. A sol-gel derived Z...

                            Mineralizer is a key factor in hydrothermal crystallization of most metal oxide materials, however, the role of it on crystal facet growth still needs further basic understandings. In this paper, YbFeO3 is taken as a model compound to disclose the effect of mineralizer on the shape evolution of YbFeO3 in mild hydrothermal crystallization process. B...
