              Abstract
              The superior strength and toughness of biological tissues have provided significant motivation for synthesizing advanced structural materials, while precisely reproducing the hierarchical microstructures of biological materials remains a huge challenge. In this study, we developed a nacre-inspired toughening ceramic composite by precisely combining two brittle compounds (graphene and calcium silicate) after rationally calculating the reduced graphene oxide (rGO) backbone structure through vacuum-assisted perfusion followed by a cold pressing treatment. The calcium silicate was confined within interconnected rGO sheets, resulting in a laminate interpenetrated microstructure with flexural strength and fracture energy over 5 times higher than that of conventional calcium silicate. The biomimetic graphene/calcium silicate composite (GCSC) exhibited significantly improved flexural strength (26.39 MPa), fracture energy (121.0 N/m), fracture toughness (1.5 MPa·m1/2), and Young’s modulus (40 GPa). Through multiscale simulations and nanostructure characterization, the exceptional mechanical properties of GCSC stemmed from the synergistic reinforcement of rGO and confinement-induced crystallization of calcium-silicate-hydrate. The unique mechanical properties of GCSC were identified from both intrinsic (nanoconfined microcavities enhanced silicate crystals) and extrinsic (controllable graphene backbone induced crack deflection) perspectives. The nacre inspired GCSC has paved a new pathway to synthesize biomimetic laminar structure of ceramic composites that possesses high strength and toughness concurrently.
