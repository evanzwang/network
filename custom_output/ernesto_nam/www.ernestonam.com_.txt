      i'm a junior at stanford doing computer science / ai track. i have a deep interest in tech. some areas that excite me are consumer applications of gen ai, productivity tools, some new type of social, among others. i also think about some more structural problems like why international shipping is always hard and how traffic lights can be a source of more efficient transportation systems. i took two gap years before stanford.
