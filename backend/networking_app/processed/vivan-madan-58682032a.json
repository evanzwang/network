    "long_description": "Vivan Madan is currently a freshman at the University of Maryland, where he is pursuing a dual focus in Computer Science and Mathematics (2024-2028). As a newcomer to the collegiate academic environment, Vivan represents the next generation of computational thinkers who are building their foundation in both the theoretical aspects of mathematics and the practical applications of computer science.\n\nWhile Vivan's professional profile is still developing, his choice of dual disciplines suggests an interest in the mathematical foundations that underpin modern AI and computational methods. The combination of CS and Math is particularly valuable for areas like machine learning algorithms, data analysis, and theoretical computer science.\n\nAs a participant in an AI hackathon, Vivan demonstrates early initiative to gain hands-on experience in applying his academic knowledge to real-world AI challenges, showing promise as an emerging talent in the field despite being at the beginning of his academic journey."
