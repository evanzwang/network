  "main_content": "2023 List Nominations About Olsen Budanur , 22 Hacker Share this profile Some individuals stand out as natural leaders, and Olsen Budanur is one of them. With an exceptional work ethic, he\u2019s gone above and beyond to create new opportunities for the hacker community and bring others into the world of tech. Olsen was a digital child growing up in the DC Metro Area. He loved video games and computers as a kid, but his love for tech really took off in middle school. Using VisualBasic\u2019s GUI-based desktop app, he was able to create simple apps that got him excited for more challenging projects. His coding adventures took off in high school, and he credits Major League Hacking (MLH) hackathons with truly igniting his passion for code. Olsen\u2019s first hackathon was VTHacks 7 in 2019. It was after this hackathon that his future became crystal clear. He says, \u201cI discovered that I have a passion for coding and building things, and I enjoyed the challenge of coming up with innovative solutions to problems. After the hackathon, I continued to attend various events and meetups within the hacker community.\u201d Since that first hackathon, he has attended seven more MLH Member hackathons. The enjoyment of building and coding things from scratch has kept his fire burning brightly, and he still thrives in the competitive environment hackathons offer. Through hackathons, he also discovered a side of hacking that he did not realize existed before: community. He says, \u201cBeing surrounded by like-minded individuals who share my passion for technology has been incredibly inspiring, and I have made lifelong connections as a result.\u201d Olsen soon saw his potential as an organizer and a leader. When he enrolled in Davidson College , he jumped at the chance to create the school\u2019s first ever student-led hackathon. Hack@Davidson brought in over 90 participants and Olsen\u2019s team was able to raise more than $6,000 in funding, leveraging the MLH Pizza Fund , to support the event. The best part for Olsen was seeing the excitement, creation, and collaboration going on during the hackathon\u2014he felt that he had made a remarkable contribution to his campus community. Olsen\u2019s work didn\u2019t stop there. He also founded Competitive Coding at Davidson , which has proven to be a great success. C-CAD prepares members for software engineering jobs and internships, hosts workshops, and competes in hackathons. The team has won 11 prizes across 7 hackathons, including a first place award at CalTech . Whether Olsen is busy hacking, organizing, or forging new ventures, he is always on an upward track. He says, \u201cI hope to continue to make a positive impact and inspire others to pursue their passion for technology and innovation.\u201d At this rate, he\u2019s well on his way to achieving those hopes.
