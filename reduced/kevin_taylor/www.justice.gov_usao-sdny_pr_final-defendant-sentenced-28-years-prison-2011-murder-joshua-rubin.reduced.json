Rakoff to 28 years in prison for his role in the October 31, 2011, murder of Joshua Rubin in Brooklyn, New York. Judge Rakoff previously sentenced co-defendants GARY ROBLES and MICHAEL MAZUR to 28 and 18 years in prison, respectively, for their roles in Rubin\u2019s murder. U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said: \u201cToday\u2019s sentencing brings long-awaited closure to the family of Joshua Rubin for the horrific events from more than a decade ago when Taylor, Robles and Mazur killed Rubin during a planned drug robbery, and then burned and abandoned Rubin\u2019s body in a deserted field in Pennsylvania. This case is another example of this Office\u2019s commitment to seeking justice for victims, even if the road to justice is long. I want to thank our law enforcement partners and the Special Agents of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for persevering in this case until justice was achieved for the victim\u2019s family.\u201d According to the allegations in the Indictment and other documents filed in federal court, as well as statements made in public court proceedings: On or about October 31, 2011, KEVIN TAYLOR, GARY ROBLES, and MICHAEL MAZUR planned to rob Joshua Rubin of a pound of marijuana. ROBLES agreed to bring a firearm to the robbery. TAYLOR lured Rubin to a Brooklyn apartment where, under the guise of purchasing the marijuana, the trio planned to rob Rubin of the drugs. On the night of the robbery, TAYLOR and ROBLES waited inside the apartment while MAZUR was positioned outside to serve as a lookout. After Rubin entered the apartment, TAYLOR and ROBLES demanded that Rubin surrender the marijuana. When Rubin refused, ROBLES shot and killed him. After the murder, TAYLOR, ROBLES, and MAZUR placed Rubin\u2019s body into the trunk of a car and drove to rural Pennsylvania. Once there, TAYLOR, ROBLES, and MAZUR placed Rubin\u2019s body in a garbage can, doused it with an accelerant, and set the body on fire. TAYLOR, ROBLES, and MAZUR then drove back to New York in the early morning hours of November 1, 2011. After the murder, TAYLOR arranged to have Rubin\u2019s credit cards used to purchase items from retail establishments in Orange County, New York. In addition, in 2019 and 2020, TAYLOR attempted to impede the federal murder investigation by paying thousands of dollars to a potential witness, and offering another witness hundreds of thousands of dollars if that witness refused to speak with law enforcement. * * * TAYLOR, 29, pled guilty to one count of robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1951 and 2, one count of conspiracy to commit robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, and one count of conspiracy to commit witness tampering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371. In connection with his guilty plea, TAYLOR admitted to his role in the murder. In addition to his prison sentence, TAYLOR, was sentenced to three years of supervised release. ROBLES, 39, pled guilty to one count of robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1951 and 2, one count of conspiracy to commit robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, and one count of narcotics conspiracy, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846 and 841(b)(1)(D). In connection with his guilty plea, ROBLES admitted to his role in the murder. In addition to his prison sentence, ROBLES, was sentenced to three years of supervised release. MAZUR, 27, pled guilty to one count of Hobbs Act robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951, and in connection with his guilty plea admitted to his role in the murder. In addition to his prison sentence, MAZUR, was sentenced to three years of supervised release. Mr. Williams praised the outstanding work of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York City Police Department, and the Special Agents of the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York. He also thanked the Lehigh County District Attorney\u2019s Office, the Pennsylvania State Police, and the South Whitehall Township Police Department for their assistance in the investigation. The case is being prosecuted by the Office\u2019s Violent and Organized Crime Unit. Assistant United States Attorneys Alexandra N. Rothman, Mollie Bracewell, and Dominic A. Gentile are in charge of the prosecution.
