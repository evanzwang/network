When you picture a cake, you probably think of a round, pretty, and decadent confection with a dainty layer of icing. But some in the business of baking are turning their talents to creating what appear to be everyday objects, but are actually sculpted from sponge and filling. Former British tattooist Ben Cullen, also known as the Bake King , is one of those people. Not only does he have a strong online following, Cullen starred on the UK's Channel 4 programme \" Extreme Cake Makers ,\" and has produced pieces which look more like his celebrity clients than the celebrities themselves .

He told Insider it was certainly something he didn't see coming. Speaking to Insider, Cullen said: \"I was an apprentice tattooist thinking I may eventually lead a life in that arena.\" The Bake King He made the leap from using skin as a canvas to instead using sponge. The Bake King However, a chance encounter with the mother of one of his tattoo clients kicked off an interest in cake as a form of art. The Bake King \"I remember doing a tattoo on a girl, and her mom, who was there to hold her hand, was talking to me about art,\" he said. The Bake King \"She had an interest in art as a cake decorator and went on to show me some of her fondant figures that she had made,\" he said. The Bake King \"They looked like toys to me. I had no real previous knowledge of what could be made using a sweet edible medium, so it instantly had me intrigued.\" The Bake King Cullen said he went away and tried it out himself. \"It wasn't easy by any stretch and my first few attempts were shocking. But I was hooked, and obsessed with getting better and learning more.\" The Bake King He said his skill improved as he made more and more cakes for family and friends. The Bake King With patience and dedication, Cullen told Insider he slowly tried to test himself and raise the bar of his abilities... The Bake King ...and he's still doing it now. The Bake King One of his favorite cakes was a seven ft \"ringmaster\" he made for the yearly \"Cake International\" show, which acted as the \"first installation that thousands of people saw.\" The Bake King \"Not only was it one of the biggest cakes I've made, it was 100% my style of art,\" he said, adding that he was proud to be the front attraction artist having been a spectator at the show for years. The Bake King Targeting a generation who are pretty tough to shock, it's a testament to Cullen's skills that he has been able to gain such a following \u2014 he currently has more than 200,000 followers on Instagram. The Bake King It's safe to say Cullen has made his mark on the world of edible art.
