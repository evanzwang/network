Lee Gilboa 2024-25 Graduate Fellow, Ph.D. Candidate in Music lee_gilboa@brown.edu Lee Gilboa is a sixth-year doctoral candidate in the Department of Music, specializing in multichannel audio composition and sound studies. In addition, she serves as an Assistant Professor in Berklee College of Music\u2019s Department of Electronic Production and Design. Her creative and scholarly work engages with themes such as the sonic identity, representation, collectivity, and self-expression.

In a forthcoming publication, \u201cAgainst All Odds: Listening for Vocality and Heardness in Oral Testimonies\u201d ( Resonance: The Journal of Sound and Culture ), she introduces a transcription methodology that is attuned to the vocality of the testimony through the analysis of Central Park Five member Korey Wise\u2019s coerced confession. Her research received funding from the Jerusalem Institute of Contemporary Music and was supported by Elektronmusikstudion (EMS)\u2019s Artist in Residence Program. Her music was featured in Folly Systems, Cube Fest, NYCEMF, Experimental Intermedia, and Ars-Electronica\u2019s Forum Wallis festivals, among others. She participated in conferences and artist residencies internationally, including Ircam\u2019s ManiFeste Academy, the Atlantic Center for the Arts, the Sound of Sound Studies, and the SpokenWeb Symposium. Nomaan Hasan 2024-25 Graduate Fellow, Ph.D. Candidate in Anthropology nomaan_hasan@brown.edu Nomaan Hasan is a sixth-year doctoral candidate in the Department of Anthropology. His dissertation, titled \u201cExperiments in Collective Selfhood on the Last Days of Democracy,\u201d examines how minoritized groups imagine and articulate political identity under conditions of democratic disrepair. Fieldwork for the project was conducted in northern India with the support of the National Science Foundation, Wenner-Gren Foundation, Society for the Scientific Study of Religion, and several intramural grants. This research has appeared or is forthcoming in Anthropology and Humanism and the Political and Legal Anthropology Review . Prior to Brown, Hasan studied sociology at the Delhi School of Economics. Amanda Macedo Macedo 2024-25 Graduate Fellow, Ph.D. Candidate in Theatre Arts & Performance Studies amanda_macedo_macedo@brown.edu Amanda Macedo Macedo is a fourth-year doctoral candidate in the Department of Theatre Arts and Performance Studies. Her research interests encompass cultural geography, transnational feminisms, decolonial thought, visual culture, and sound studies. In her dissertation project tentatively titled \u201cUnraveling Resistance: Aesthetic Interventions in the Face of Imperial Violences,\u201d she critically examines the impacts of imperialism that produce an unjust distribution of death and exploitation towards minoritarian bodies, with a particular focus on contemporary Mexico. Through the lens of aesthetic interventions, she aims to provide a nuanced understanding of how experiences of violence and resilience influence the political realm. By recognizing the body as a site for knowledge production and resistance, she explores practices of radical imagination, subversion, and disruption that challenge established power structures. Prior to her doctoral studies at Brown, she earned an M.A. in communication from the Graduate Program in Political and Social Sciences at Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico (UNAM) and a B.A. in political science and social management from Universidad Aut\u00f3noma Metropolitana Xochimilco (UAM-X). Katharina Weygold 2024-25 Graduate Fellow, Ph.D. Candidate in American Studies katharina_weygold@brown.edu Katharina Weygold is a fifth-year doctoral candidate in the Department of American Studies. She specializes in Black internationalism, 20th-century African American history, U.S. imperialism, and transnational American studies. In her dissertation, she studies African American women\u2019s ideas about Haiti and their writing, performances, artwork, and interactions and collaborations with Haitians, in the context of U.S. imperialism in Haiti from the U.S. occupation (1915\u20131934) to the Duvalier regime (1957\u20131986). Drawing on archival sources and oral histories, the project explores how focusing on women changes our understanding of the meaning of Haiti and U.S. imperialism for African Americans. Weygold holds an M.A. in public humanities from Brown University and an M.A. in American studies from Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz, Germany. Her research has received funding from the Center for the Study of Race and Ethnicity in America, the John Hope Franklin Research Center for African and African American History and Culture at Duke University, and the Roosevelt Institute for American Studies in the Netherlands.",
