Hard to get a good grade but hard to fail as well. Weekly readings that are long and a weekly quiz that isn't too hard if you did the reading. Final paper is weighted way too high so if you get anything lower than an A you'll probably end with lower than an A for your final grade. Tough grader Lots of homework Helpful 0 0 MINGRP Jan 10th, 2025 Quality 1.0 Difficulty 4.0 MINGRP Jan 10th, 2025 First asynch class that I took at Rutgers that I really disliked. Felt like I was honestly putting more effort into this class sometimes than my STEM classes because of her grading. She was also really behind on grading and her prompts were worded so weirdly / awkwardly. Lowk passive aggressive and not super helpful when you need help. Helpful 0 0 MINGRP Jan 6th, 2025 Quality 1.0 Difficulty 4.0 MINGRP Jan 6th, 2025 Textbook : N/A Online Class : Yes one word: bombast Get ready to read Helpful 0 0 MINGRP Jan 4th, 2025 Quality 1.0 Difficulty 4.0 MINGRP Jan 4th, 2025 For Credit : Yes honestly one of my least favorite professors at rutgers. try not to take her if you can Helpful 0 0 MINGRP Jan 4th, 2025 Quality 1.0 Difficulty 4.0 MINGRP Jan 4th, 2025 For Credit : Yes terrible and annoying Helpful 0 0 MINGRPAMSOC Jan 4th, 2025 Quality 1.0 Difficulty 4.0 MINGRPAMSOC Jan 4th, 2025 For Credit : Yes Textbook : N/A Online Class : Yes her prompts and the way she words things are rlly, let's just say interesting... I feel like she wants to sound smart?? lol. Honestly you gotta decipher what she's trying to say bec of her diction. gets really passive agressive, not helpful, repeats herself a lot in her lecture videos, always behind on grading, not an easy A whatsoever Helpful 0 0 MINGRPAMSOC Jan 4th, 2025 Quality 1.0 Difficulty 4.0 MINGRPAMSOC Jan 4th, 2025 For Credit : Yes Attendance : Not Mandatory Textbook : N/A Not a a helpful or caring professor and she words things in a really confusing manner a lot of the times and stutters a lot in her lecture videos which is kinda funny actually. Would not recommend taking this class. Not that many assignments so your grade is really dependent on her discussion post and one essay grade and she grades tough. annoying. Helpful 0 0 MINGRPAMSOC Jan 4th, 2025 Quality 1.0 Difficulty 4.0 MINGRPAMSOC Jan 4th, 2025 For Credit : Yes Attendance : Not Mandatory Textbook : N/A Online Class : Yes Grades hard, always says you're not using enough outside resources when I incorporated multiple. Ended up putting a lot of effort into an asynch class (scared I wasn't going to end with an A). Made us have a meeting about our essay with her AFTER we submitted which made 0 sense because it's submitted..what is the point..you can't fix it anymore. Tough grader Graded by few things Helpful 0 0 MINGRPSSOC108 Jan 17th, 2023 Quality 3.0 Difficulty 3.0 MINGRPSSOC108 Jan 17th, 2023 For Credit : Yes Attendance : Mandatory Grade : B Textbook : N/A Professor Lee assigns long readings each week for class, if you can complete these long readings and be heavily engaged in the long lectures you will be fine in her class. However at times her lectures can get boring so beware of that. Tests were ten questions and were not hard if you did all the readings and paid attention to the long lectures. Get ready to read Lecture heavy Helpful 0 0 MINGRPAMSOC Nov 16th, 2022 Quality 3.0 Difficulty 4.0 MINGRPAMSOC Nov 16th, 2022 For Credit : Yes Attendance : Mandatory Textbook : N/A At first she seemed okay, but she is often upset at the grades my class as a whole are getting. She also gives quizzes that have very very similar answer choices. And takes a while to grade. She seems like a good person, but not my favorite prof. Tough grader Helpful 0 0 SOC300 Nov 8th, 2022 Quality 2.0 Difficulty 3.0 SOC300 Nov 8th, 2022 For Credit : Yes Attendance : Not Mandatory Grade : Not sure yet Textbook : Yes Online Class : Yes If there's other professors, take those instead. She is not like the reviews. She is a tough grader and didn't grade anything until after the drop period. There is no extra credit and no understanding from her if you have a medical emergency. She seems nice, but then turns very passive aggressive. Very vague with wording on assignments & everything Tough grader Get ready to read Helpful 0 0 SOC300 Nov 4th, 2022 Quality 2.0 Difficulty 5.0 SOC300 Nov 4th, 2022 For Credit : Yes Attendance : Not Mandatory Grade : Not sure yet Textbook : Yes Online Class : Yes I'm not sure what changed with her, but she's not like the reviews anymore. She assigns a lot of reading per week and expects you to cite a good majority of them in discussions and essays. Her midterm essay question was very vague with unclear grading criteria. Also super behind in grading so no one knows where they stand. Tough grader Get ready to read Lecture heavy Helpful 0 0 MINORITY108 Dec 13th, 2021 Quality 4.0 Difficulty 2.0 MINORITY108 Dec 13th, 2021 For Credit : Yes Attendance : Not Mandatory Would Take Again : Yes Grade : A+ Textbook : No Online Class : Yes I took this class async, the easiest A ever. I put her lectures on every Friday night as a podcast while cleaning my dorm. The weekly quizzes are very easy, 3-4 multiple choice questions based on the lecture. The writing prompts are very confusing though, repetitive and say the same thing but she says they are \"different\". But she grades lightly. Helpful 0 0 SOC108 Jan 14th, 2021 Quality 4.0 Difficulty 1.0 SOC108 Jan 14th, 2021 For Credit : Yes Attendance : Mandatory Would Take Again : Yes Grade : A Textbook : No She's a little awkward but definitely an amazing professor and Minority Groups in American Society is so cool. Prof. Lee definitely pays attention so don't try to use your phone but she also cares about her students and let us out early sometimes. Her tests are tricky but if you pay attention you'll be fine and you don't need to do the readings. Amazing lectures Helpful 0 0 MINGRPSSOC108 Dec 8th, 2020 Quality 5.0 Difficulty 1.0 MINGRPSSOC108 Dec 8th, 2020 Would Take Again : Yes Textbook : No Online Class : Yes she's so understanding if you fall behind or need extra help and she makes it clear that she cares about your mental health. there's a short quiz every week that's easy as long as you watch the lecture. she assigns long readings but i didn't read any of them and did fine. pretty easy course and i learned a lot, i'd def recommend! Accessible outside class Caring Helpful 0 0 SOC108 May 7th, 2020 Quality 4.0 Difficulty 3.0 SOC108 May 7th, 2020 For Credit : Yes Would Take Again : Yes Grade : B+ Textbook : No Online Class : Yes Professor Lee is very kind and understanding. Class isn't hard but if you don't watch the lectures it's not as interesting. Never did the readings but that didn't effect my performance. Helpful 0 0 SOC108 Jan 14th, 2020 Quality 3.0 Difficulty 2.0 SOC108 Jan 14th, 2020 For Credit : Yes Attendance : Mandatory Would Take Again : Yes Grade : A Textbook : No One of my favorite professors. Took time out to meet with us in groups outside of class to get to know us. As long as you pay attention in lecture and study it is an easy A. Get ready to read Participation matters Amazing lectures Helpful 0 0 MINORITY108 Dec 18th, 2018 Quality 1.0 Difficulty 4.0 MINORITY108 Dec 18th, 2018 For Credit : Yes Attendance : Mandatory Would Take Again : No Grade : Not sure yet Textbook : No Get ready to read sometimes 30 page articles for a mere one question on a quiz or exam. The setup of the course honestly isn't really fair and not only that but it sounds like an interesting class upon taking it. Well take the class and youll see how interesting it is. Get ready to read Skip class? You won't pass. LOTS OF HOMEWORK Helpful 1 0 SOC108 Dec 17th, 2018 Quality 2.0 Difficulty 4.0 SOC108 Dec 17th, 2018 For Credit : Yes Attendance : Mandatory Would Take Again : No Grade : Not sure yet Textbook : No Professor assigns a lot of readings and you must read and memorize for exams. Exam questions are not always straight forward, and during lectures she can get off topic and it is very confusing. Tough Grader Get ready to read TEST HEAVY Helpful 0 0 MINGRPSSOC108 Nov 15th, 2018 Quality 2.0 Difficulty 4.0 MINGRPSSOC108 Nov 15th, 2018 For Credit : Yes Attendance : Mandatory Would Take Again : No Grade : Not sure yet Textbook : No She's a good person who is very passionate about what she teaches, but the amount of readings you have to do each week is overwhelming. If I weren't taking any classes but this one it'd be fine but obviously I am taking other classes so I don't have enough time to read everything. Definitely not an easy A class.
