He joined UCF in 2018 as an assistant professor and key member of the Future City Initiative. He is the founding director of the Urban Intelligence and Smart City (URBANITY) Lab and currently serves as the director of Future City Initiative. He was previously (2016-18) an Assistant Professor in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at California State University, Los Angeles. He completed his post-doctoral research at New York University (2016) and his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (2015). His B.Tech. degree is in Electronics and Communication Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Guwahati. His research focuses on interdisciplinary areas of cyber-physical systems, smart and connected transportation, and connected and autonomous vehicles. Passionate about cross-disciplinary research, he integrates control theory, information science, data-driven techniques, and mathematical modeling in his work. He has published one book, over 35 peer-reviewed publications, and multiple conference papers. His work has been funded by several private and government agencies including Oculus, FHWA, and FDOT. He is a senior member of IEEE and serves as an associate editor of IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems.
