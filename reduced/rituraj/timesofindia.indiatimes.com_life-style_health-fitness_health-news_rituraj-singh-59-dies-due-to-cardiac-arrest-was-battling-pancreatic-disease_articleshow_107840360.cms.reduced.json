He was known for his roles in shows like Anupamaa and movies like Badrinath ki Dulhania. Pancreatic diseases, including cancer and pancreatitis, have limited treatment options and pose significant challenges. The diseases encompass a spectrum of conditions affecting the pancreas, a vital organ nestled behind the stomach. Rituraj Singh , a popular face in the television industry , passed away on Monday night due to cardiac arrest . Rituraj was battling pancreatic disease , ETimes reported. He was 59. \"Yes he passed away due to cardiac arrest. He was admitted to a hospital some time back for treatment of pancreas returned home had some cardiac complications and passed away,\" close friend of the actor Amit Behl confirmed it to the media. As per his friend, he was battling pancreatic disease. \"Acute inflammation of pancreas is called Acute Pancreatitis. It can be caused by multiple reasons including infections, drugs, high triglycerides, high calcium etc. But two of the most common causes are alcohol and slipping of gall stone into bile duct. Excess amount, consumption over long time or a binge of alcohol can all cause pancreatitis,\" Dr Ajay Kumar, Chairman-Pan Max, Gastroenterology, Hepatology and HOD, Institute For Digestive & Liver Diseases, BLK-Max Super Speciality Hospital, New Delhi. \"Acute pancreatitis presents as excruciating severe pain in upper abdomen,\" he adds. \"Pancreatitis is related to cardiac disease in two ways i.e. Quite often it can cause confusion and may mimic heart pain resulting in problems in diagnosis. Also, Pancreatitis affects cardiac contractibility, rhythm, and vasomotor tone of peripheral vessels. Pancreatitis also causes ECG changes in almost 50% of patients of acute pancreatitis. This causes confusion in diagnosis,\" Dr. Kumar adds. \"At the same time, if we are not conscious of it, we can miss the diagnosis of heart attack in patients with upper abdominal pain,\" he concluded. Cancer is curable if detected early: Signs to pay attention to Pancreatic diseases like pancreatitis can induce systemic inflammation and metabolic imbalances, increasing the risk of cardiovascular complications . Chronic pancreatitis elevates the likelihood of atherosclerosis, predisposing individuals to heart disease and potentially cardiac arrest. Moreover, pancreatic cancer's metastatic spread can infiltrate surrounding tissues, including the heart, leading to arrhythmias or myocardial dysfunction. Additionally, certain medications used in pancreatic disease management may impact cardiac function, exacerbating the risk. Rituraj Singh was immensely loved for portraying characters like Yashpal in Anupamaa, Purushottam Ajmera in Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai, Mahendra Singh in Diya Aur Baati Hum. He has also starred in web series like Bandish Bandits, Made in Heaven, etc. and movies like Badrinath ki Dulhania, Satyameva Jayate 2 and Yaariyan 2.
