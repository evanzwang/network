  "main_content": "I\u2019m Kushal (pronounced /k\u028a\u0283\u0259l/ ), an undergrad at Stanford studying Computer Science. Previously, I worked on the science of neural network training at STAIR , adversarial attacks at CAIS , and now think about in-context learning & build new LM architectures at Stanford NLP , supervised by Prof. Chris Manning and Prof. Chris Potts . In my spare time, I like to do photography to make the world feel a bit more mythic, swim, think about culture & endogenous growth theory, and counter my perpetual onism by hiking mountains. Reach out if you\u2019d like to chat about anything you think we\u2019d both enjoy! news Jul 17, 2024 I have been awarded an Emergent Ventures grant by Tyler Cowen . May 11, 2024 I presented my co-first author interpretability paper Incidental Polysemanticity as a poster at the Representational Alignment workshop and the Bridging the Gap Between Practice and Theory in Deep Learning (BGPT) workshop at ICLR 2024 in Vienna, Austria. Feb 25, 2024 I presented our paper on Probabilistic Syllable Structure at the 42nd West Coast Conference on Formal Linguistics (WCCFL) at Berkeley, CA. Feb 3, 2024 I am a Teaching Assistant for the course CS21SI: AI for Social Good in Spring 2024. Come hear me talk about RL and unsupervised learning! Dec 15, 2023 First day at the Center for AI Safety , where I\u2019m working on vision adversarial attacks with Dan Hendrycks . May 21, 2022 I have been awarded the Atlas Fellowship . Jul 1, 2021 I attended the national orientation & selection olympiad camp for the International Olympiad in Astronomy and Astrophysics ( IOAA ), organized by HBCSE . May 28, 2021 I was part of the five person team that represented India at the International Young Physicists\u2019 Tournament ( IYPT ). Dec 17, 2020 I won the Honorable Mention award at the International Physics Olympiad (which was held as a distributed event due to COVID-19). Jun 16, 2019 I achieved national rank 5 in Physics at the STEMS exam and subsequently attended their camp on Physics, Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science at the Chennai Mathematical Institute . email or tweet at me!",
