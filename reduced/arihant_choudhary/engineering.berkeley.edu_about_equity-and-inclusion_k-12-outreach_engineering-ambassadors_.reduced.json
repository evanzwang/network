  "main_content": "Home > About > Equity and inclusion > K-12 outreach > Engineering Ambassadors Engineering Ambassadors In response to feedback from our partners, we established an Engineering Ambassadors program in August 2022. Our Engineering Ambassadors program consists of Berkeley undergraduate students that support K-12 outreach through a variety of activities, including campus tours, presentations, career panels, and school visits. As tangible proof of their value, our ambassadors are hired as student assistants and paid a competitive wage. Our ambassador program is part of the Engineering Ambassadors Network , led by Penn State. The Engineering Ambassadors Network (EAN) is an alliance of universities that aims to train a cohort of diverse and technically skilled engineering undergraduates on how to excite K-12 students about engineering. Since 2010, EAN has reached more than 45,000 K-12 students. EAN also provides professional development training for the ambassadors themselves \u2013 important soft skills that students can apply in their future careers. Schools and community organizations can request tours, presentations, or other activities by submitting a request through our contact form . (We also welcome requests for virtual activities.) We currently focus on offering one-off events/activities rather than recurring programs. Ambassador activities Our school and community partners guide and inform our ambassadors\u2019 outreach activities. We also encourage our ambassadors to suggest activities. Example activities are listed below: Developing new presentations that introduce young students to engineering topics Leading tours of Berkeley Engineering\u2019s buildings Facilitating hands-on activities or leading presentations as part of a class or after-school program in local K-12 schools Conducting hands-on activities during community festivals or K-12 school events Participating in student panels Creating social media posts to share Berkeley Engineering students\u2019 experiences Supporting Berkeley Engineering\u2019s K-12 Outreach Team with planning, preparing for events, and our overall activities Ambassadors also engage in communications training and other professional development activities, including the Engineering Ambassador Network\u2019s communication training program . Meet our ambassadors We recruited ambassadors who are passionate about diversifying engineering, and we are thrilled with our first cohort of ambassadors. In future years we expect to move experienced students into leadership positions, making it possible to streamline training and grow our ambassador team. Mahika Behani Hi! I\u2019m Mahika, and I use the she/her/hers pronouns! I am from Bangalore, India, and I\u2019m a sophomore studying Environmental Engineering. I\u2019ve always been really passionate about sustainability, and I love all things outdoorsy \u2013 I scuba-dive and surf, and I\u2019m on the Sailing Team here at Berkeley! Back home, there isn\u2019t a lot of female representation in STEM, and I\u2019m proud to be the first girl in my family to study engineering. I\u2019m excited to help raise awareness about all the wonderful women in STEM in this world and inspire girls to follow their dreams and pursue a STEM degree! Arihant Choudhary Hi! My name is Arihant Choudhary (he/him/his). I\u2019m a junior from Kolkata, India studying CS and Data Science. I enjoy working on projects that help create meaningful impact and foster learning and academic growth. I also really like puzzle-solving and playing games. I like talking about failure and want to help de-stigmatize the embarrassment around talking about failing (especially in a highly competitive environment like college and in fields like engineering). I\u2019m always excited to talk to and meet new people! Sophia Dateshidze Hi there! My name is Sophia and I use the she/her/hers pronouns! I am from Los Angeles, California, and I am in my 3rd year studying Bioengineering with a concentration in both Synthetic and Computational Biology and Cell and Tissue Engineering. I chose to major in Bioengineering because of how interdisciplinary and vast the curriculum is and its applications in making new medical technologies. For as long as I can remember, I have wanted to help people by making medical treatment more accessible, and at Berkeley, I\u2019ve discovered a passion for research. I believe it\u2019s important for others to know that engineering is for everyone\u2014no matter how intimidating it may appear. I hope to inspire others to take the leap and explore all engineering has to offer. Outside of my classes, I am passionate about working with animals, and I love spending time outdoors, playing volleyball, and baking. Preetal Deshpande Hello! My name is Preetal Deshpande (she/her), and I\u2019m from Cupertino, CA. I\u2019m a sophomore at UC Berkeley, majoring in Bioengineering and minoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS). From a young age, I\u2019ve been passionate about healthcare and driven to make a meaningful impact in my community. Bioengineering allows me to combine my love for science and technology to improve lives through innovative research and biotechnology solutions. I\u2019m deeply involved in research, constantly seeking to learn more about the human body and the incredible potential of technology in healthcare. Beyond coursework and the lab, I am passionate about bridging the gaps in STEM\u2014whether it be addressing gender disparities, improving representation, or making education more accessible to underserved communities. I\u2019m dedicated to educating and inspiring others, fostering a positive impact, and helping create an inclusive future for all. Alejandro Hernandez Hello! I am Alejandro Hernandez (he/him), but you can call me Alex. I grew up in the Central Valley of California, born in Delano and raised in Earlimart. I am currently in my third year here at UC Berkeley with Senior standing, majoring in Electrical Engineering & Computer Sciences. Since I grew up in a very rural area of California, I was never really exposed to the wonders of engineering before college. I had no idea what career I wanted to pursue in life and no clue what I was getting myself into! The only thing that I knew was this: I wanted to change the world. Over the years, I became very fond of the Internet of Things, the electrical and computational devices that interconnect us all. That\u2019s how I blindly decided that electrical engineering was the career path I wanted, but I want you all to know that the takeaway here isn\u2019t to have your life completely figured out before college. The lesson is that to develop a passion for something you have to be willing to learn more about it; it isn\u2019t always love at first sight. Jordan Kam Hello! My name is Jordan Kam (he/him/his), and I am from San Bernardino, CA. Currently, I am a sophomore undergraduate studying Aerospace Engineering here at UC Berkeley with a passion for Space Technology. My motivation for choosing Aerospace Engineering lies in my dad\u2019s dream of exploring the stars. My goal in life is to help others achieve that same wish through engineering and innovation. Outside of engineering, I am very passionate about spending time with my friends and connecting with people socially. Nothing beats a trip to the beach! Nadeen Mohamed Hi! I am Nadeen Mohamed (she/her), and I am from Sacramento, CA. I am a second-year majoring in Civil Engineering and minoring in Spanish. Growing up in Dubai, I had the opportunity to see one of the most impressive cities in the world come to life. Engineering became a unifying force for me, bringing people from all walks of life together in the city. Over time, I recognized that Civil Engineering would be a fulfilling path for me. Besides coursework, I enjoy learning about different cultures and languages. Currently, my focus is on Spanish, but I plan on continuing my efforts to expand my cultural education in the future. I am a firm believer that the first step to bridging animosity between people is through education and empathy. Ria Nakahara My name is Ria Nakahara (she/her), and I\u2019m a 3rd year studying data science at Berkeley. I was born in Tokyo, Japan, and grew up in Singapore prior to entering university. As someone who loves to read and write in her free time, there is nothing more compelling to me than using numbers to uncover stories. I am a big Studio Ghibli fan (think My Neighbor Totoro and Spirited Away) and would love to learn how to crochet the adorable characters! Dylan O\u2019Dwyer Hi! My name is Dylan O\u2019Dwyer (he/him), and I\u2019m from San Fernando Valley, Los Angeles. I\u2019m a Junior (3rd year) majoring in Mechanical Engineering and minoring in education. I have always wanted to help others through engineering, and Berkeley provides a place where I can master my skills in engineering while gathering different perspectives from my peers and professors. One perspective I have gained as an engineering student at Berkeley is that we are not always perfect or correct. In most cases, it takes multiple errors or mistakes to learn how to solve problems, and that\u2019s the best way to learn. I am also a huge sports person. I played baseball for seven years, and I just bought a new glove to start playing catch again. Mandy Pham Hi, my name is Mandy Pham, and I use she/her pronouns. I am originally from Elk Grove/Sacramento and am a second-year student studying EECS (Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences). I am studying EECS to explore more opportunities and find interrelated disciplines that I would like to explore in industry and the educational sector. I believe engineering should be accessible to all. As an ambassador and first-generation college student, I hope to provide resources, support, and advice to all students. Outside of engineering, I love to dance and am a part of Main Stacks and AFX Comp! Some other hobbies include cooking, hiking, cafe hopping, and trying new foods! Shishira Somashekar Hi everyone, my name is Shishira, and I use the she/her/hers pronouns. I am in my second year studying Industrial Engineering & Operations Research (IEOR) with a Data Science minor. I am from a town right outside of Durham, North Carolina! I came to UC Berkeley as an Environmental Engineering Science major and have now made my way into IEOR. Switching majors has been a journey, and I am looking forward to exploring my interests in renewable energy/sustainability through the lens of IEOR. Outside of my coursework, I enjoy being outdoors, running, thrifting, and spending quality time with family and friends. I am excited to share how truly endless the possibilities with engineering are and that there is really no singular linear path that an engineer \u201cshould\u201d take!",
