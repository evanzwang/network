At Stanford, I am deeply involved in both academic and extracurricular activities that allow me to explore and innovate within this exciting field. My journey has been marked by significant achievements, including winning the Grand Prize at TreeHacks 2024, Stanford's renowned hackathon. During this event, my team and I developed innovative technology solutions aimed at creating tangible benefits for people. My projects often focus on empathy and practical applications, striving to make a positive impact on society. In addition to my hackathon successes, I am a dedicated student researcher. My research experiences include working under Dr Bianchi at The Bianchi Lab at the Miller School of Medicine where I gained valuable insights and skills into cognitive disorders and brain lesions. I am committed to leveraging technology for positive change and look forward to continuing this journey of exploration and innovation.
