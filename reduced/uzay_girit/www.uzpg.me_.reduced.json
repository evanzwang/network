I do theory of deep learning research in the Isola lab , and am currently particularly interested in a) the dynamics of in context adaptivity, and b) building robust legible world models that allow for improved long horizon performance and human empowerment. I am currently looking for research opportunities for the spring/especially summer period, so feel free to reach out. Interests: poetry/literature, writing , climbing, pure math, programming, mountains Things I get up to: trying to get better at research Amateur poetry, philosophy and writing I think AI will change the world and want to figure out what to do about it at MAIA I want to build better interfaces for learning and creativity using AI. Things I have affiliation to: Pika , Fabric, Emergent Ventures , France. Links: twitter , github , goodreads . Check out my blog - Here is some stuff I\u2019ve written: on climbing , year review , beyond good and evil .
