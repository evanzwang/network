  "main_content": "Thomaz Bonato Chief Financial Officer Diabetes and endocrinology AstraZeneca Australia Biography In July 2017, Thomaz was appointed Interim Country President of AstraZeneca Australia and New Zealand. He brings with him a wealth of experience achieved through 20 years in the pharmaceutical industry. Thomaz is also the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) at AstraZeneca Australia and New Zealand, and is responsible for Finance across Commercial and Operations, Procurement and Information Services. Previously, Thomaz worked in Brazil as CFO and was responsible for implementing the Shared Service Centre for Finance with our global partner Genpact, as well as being the sponsor of the SAP regionalisation project where he was aggregating Brazil within the Latin America SAP Platform. He also supported the Business Development Team in the potential acquisition of local Brazilian companies. Thomaz was in this role from 2009 until the end of 2011. From 2006 to 2009, Thomaz was based in Costa Rica as CFO of Central American, Caribbean and Middle Andean Market Region. He was responsible for Finance, Procurement, IS, Compliance, Logistics and Supply Chain and in charge of 24 countries in this CAMCAR Region. His main accountabilities were to create the Marketing Company Unit and implement a new business model for the whole organisation where he looked for synergies, more robust processes, better controls and tax savings, as well as implemented a SAP and Payroll System to support the entire company. During his time there as a CFO he was able to create a strong and recognised support team, helping grow it from 4 to 22 people and to support the business to more than double revenue and contribution. When he joined AZ in May 1997, Thomaz had roles in different departments: Financial Controller, Strategic Planning Manager and Treasury Manager in Brazil. One of the main projects he worked on was to support the business during the company\u2019s globalisation project of 2003. The result was a 35% growth, with some products almost doubling their market share and sales during that period. Research Interest Prior to working at AstraZeneca, Thomaz worked in different finance departments in Monsanto for more than six years.
