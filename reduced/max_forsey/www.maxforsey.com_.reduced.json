This modification to traditional Sparse Autoencoders leads to more faithful reconstructions and more effective model steering capabilities. FreshSesh AI project A developer tool that uses a local LLM to provide personalized context summaries of your previous work sessions. Helps you quickly get back into flow by recapping where you left off. maxforsey.com project This website has become so much fun to work on and to experiment with design principles. It's also how I learned next.js and tailwind CSS! Below are some previous iterations.",
