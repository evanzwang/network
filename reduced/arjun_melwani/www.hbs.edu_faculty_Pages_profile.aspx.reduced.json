View Details Research Summary Overview How can technology entrepreneurs build competitive advantage from the ground up? Professor Andy Wu conducts scholarly research and develops course materials that document how technology entrepreneurs can (1) organize for innovation to create new market opportunities and (2) mobilize resources to achieve scale. These two considerations distinguish entrepreneurial strategy from incumbent strategy in technology. To intimately understand the practice and consequences of these actions for technology entrepreneurs, Professor Wu uses a variety of empirical methods: archival data, field experiments, laboratory experiments, and qualitative interviews. Entrepreneurs have a unique organizational ability to create value through innovation because they lack scale, but they need to resort to unconventional methods to persuade investors and complementors to join and enable them to build scale and capture that value. First, entrepreneurial firms have a unique ability to innovate despite, and often because of, their lack of scale: they are able to reconfigure their organizations on the dimensions of structure, time, and space\u2014in short, to innovate rapidly and efficiently. For instance, flat entrepreneurial organizations can easily alter how they coordinate and thus swap between generating usefulness and novelty, the two necessary components of innovation. Second, technology entrepreneurs face a unique challenge in acquiring external resources needed to scale. Entrepreneurs without scale can communicate the potential of scale to investors and complementors, and they can select for parties that favorably perceive that potential. These two streams reflect the lifecycle of strategies for the technology entrepreneur: first, how the very nascent entrepreneur can innovate without scale; second, how the entrepreneur can get the resources to build a scale advantage around that innovation. Professor Wu\u2019s interest in this topic stems from his experience as an entrepreneur and inventor predating my own academic career. His family immigrated to the United States for the dynamism around technology and entrepreneurship, representing what the best of the American Dream. Since his youth, he helped his family in software ventures and even restaurants. On his own, he launched a (still growing) venture to bring cutting-edge drone and cloud-based big data technology to the industrial sector.

What strategies win in markets with network effects? How can technology be leveraged to build multisided platforms? How can firms create and capture the value from intellectual property? What are the unique challenges of governing technology-intensive firms? How can firms build and sustain value in new, emerging technologies? The course provides a series of concepts and frameworks for students to directly apply to strategic problems they will encounter as managers and executives. The course places heavy emphasis on going from concepts and market analysis to the formulation of concrete strategies. The types of firms range from pre-revenue startups to large multinationals. INDUSTRY COVERAGE Industries covered range widely, including: enterprise software, cloud services, e-commerce, social networking, video gaming, browsers, semiconductors, operating systems, PCs, media streaming, intellectual property, mobile communications, electronic ink, artificial intelligence, blockchain/cryptocurrency, internet of things, and wearable technology. CAREER FOCUS The course should be of particular interest to those interested in managing a business for which technology is likely to play a major role, and to those interested in consulting, private equity, or venture capital. The course may also be valuable for students who do not necessarily plan to pursue a career specifically in technology. The concepts and frameworks covered apply well beyond technology industries, e.g., network effects, competitive tactics, multisided platforms.
