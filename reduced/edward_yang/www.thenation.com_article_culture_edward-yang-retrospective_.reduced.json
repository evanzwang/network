Vikram Murthi Share Copy Link Facebook X (Twitter) Bluesky Pocket Email Ad Policy A scene from Confucian Confusion . (Courtesy of Janus Films) Taiwan\u2019s rapid, unprecedented economic boom in the latter half of the 20th century profoundly altered the country\u2019s social structure and reconfigured the lives of its citizens. Director Edward Yang deploys this historical context as the foundation for his films, which depict urban malaise amid global capitalism\u2019s expansion of choice. In Mahjong (1996), Yang explicates this idea by saturating the film with white, English-speaking characters, all of whom see Taipei, the director\u2019s birthplace and cinematic home turf, as an exotic land ready to be bled dry of its wealth. Marthe (Virginie Ledoyen), a young French woman, impulsively travels to Taiwan to reunite with her former paramour, Markus (Nick Erickson), a British entrepreneur whose failures in England have led him to seek out new markets in Asia. When Markus reacts obnoxiously to Marthe\u2019s sudden arrival, she spitefully decides to stay in the country and falls in with a gang of four young Taiwanese con artists. Their promises of protection thinly mask their desire to pimp her out to an American who runs a renowned escort service. Yang portrays mid-1990s Taipei as an unfettered new frontier where people\u2019s wayward desires and newly deep pockets are ripe for exploitation. (\u201cNobody knows what they want\u201d is the recurring, gleeful refrain of Mahjong \u2019s young gangsters.) While the Western \u00e9migr\u00e9s mine the country\u2019s burgeoning economy for personal gain using shady\u2014albeit technically legal\u2014means, the gang takes advantage of their own countrymen\u2019s superstitions and spiritual beliefs. Transactional relationships reign supreme in Mahjong : Everyone is either a con man or a mark, predator or prey, packed into a country where capital\u2019s relationship to power has been laid bare. Hence, intimacy of any kind remains a refuge for the traditionally sentimental, which the young, nouveau riche Taiwanese wish to shed from their national identity. Under the sway of maximum cupidity, romantic relationships are merely potential traps. Gang member Hong Kong (Chang Chen) uses his sexual prowess to lure women into bed, both as a demonstration of his power and to show off to his crew. In an especially nasty scene, a new, gullible lover discovers that any woman who wants to remain in Hong Kong\u2019s good graces must sleep with the entire gang. His emotional distance torments his partners; he refuses to kiss them, as he and the crew believe it\u2019s bad luck to exhibit such vulnerability. It\u2019s only when a group of older women wish to pass Hong Kong around like a plate of canap\u00e9s, like the gang does with his paramours, that he collapses into a puddle of humiliated tears, finally feeling the emotional price of such objectification. Meanwhile, the effects of unchecked greed trickle down through generations just as easily as different classes. Two mobsters plan to kidnap Red Fish (Tang Tsung-sheng), the gang\u2019s cocky leader, in order to blackmail his wealthy businessman father into paying back an enormous loan. Red Fish\u2019s father, who hides out from the mob in a secret love nest, confesses that all he pines for is what money can\u2019t buy, now that his investments have soured. Young and arrogant, Red Fish dismisses these starry-eyed platitudes and argues that they simply interfere with his father\u2019s avarice; he only begins to fully comprehend his father\u2019s warnings after it\u2019s too late. It\u2019s Luen-Luen (Lawrence Ko), the gang\u2019s softhearted driver and translator, who slowly sees the dehumanization inherent in such a hyper-capitalist lifestyle. Born into a modest family that rents rooms to expats, Luen-Luen feels just as lost amid the rampant upheaval in his own country as Marthe does with the language barrier. As the two forge a bond after Luen-Luen informs her of the sex-work plot, they eventually find themselves standing against the deceitful, amoral masses who wear smiles and appear affable. It\u2019s telling that one of the few two-faced phrases Red Fish can speak in English is \u201cOK! No problem!,\u201d which is something he repeats to the people he\u2019s actively trying to con. A new restoration of Mahjong made its world premiere during Lincoln Center\u2019s career retrospective of Yang\u2019s work; it screened alongside a new restoration of his other mid-\u201990s film, A Confucian Confusion (1994). Sandwiched between A Brighter Summer Day (1991) and Yi Yi (2000)\u2014two widely acclaimed epic family dramas replete with a myriad of operatic incident\u2014this pair of underseen ensemble comedies feature the late Taiwanese director at his angriest, funniest, and most cynically romantic. They both use large, interconnected ensemble casts and the visual language of farce to further explore Yang\u2019s abiding thematic concern: an ever-changing Taiwan stuck between tradition and Western-influenced modernity. Current Issue March 2025 Issue A Confucian Confusion and Mahjong also represent two of the remaining pieces in the celebrated auteur\u2019s oeuvre to receive a belated stateside spotlight since his death in 2007. Yang came to filmmaking relatively late, after spending the first half of his life in the United States putting his electrical engineering degrees to work in the tech sector while flirting with other careers. He was briefly enrolled in the University of Southern California\u2019s film school before deciding that its commercial pedagogy was not for him; he was also accepted into the Harvard Graduate School of Design but decided not to attend. Yang eventually returned to Taiwan in 1980 and helped pioneer a new wave of national cinema that sought to bring realistic portraits of modern Taiwanese life to the big screen. By the \u201980s, the Taiwanese film industry was in a state of flux\u2014its \u201cvirtual collapse,\u201d per Sight & Sound \u2019s Tony Rayns, \u201cforced a director-led cinema into being,\u201d and would-be auteurs had to become \u201cproducers, production managers, acting coaches, editors and unit publicists.\u201d Yang and his peers grew up under the oppressive, conservative orthodoxy enacted by the Kuomintang political regime; they channeled their rebellious attitudes, which were emboldened by American culture trickling into the country, into their work. In his films, Yang illustrated how city life had become a microcosm for the globe folding in on itself, until East and West become mirrors of each other, with everyone in the middle forced to sort out the identity crisis for themselves. The characters in Mahjong casually frequent imported chain restaurants like the Hard Rock Caf\u00e9 and TGI Friday\u2019s, symbols of globalism that become, once the sun sets, places of off-hours business or sites of found and often curdled love amid a big city\u2019s bright lights. But in A Confucian Confusion (1994), which treads similar ground as Mahjong , they\u2019re merely the background establishments for the upwardly mobile, a group of people who, in Yang\u2019s eyes, have adopted dishonesty as a lifestyle. Yang traces a complicated lattice of relationships between the twentysomething professionals working in corporate environments and the arts to probe the ways that the politicking required to prosper in the workplace bleeds into life outside the office. In A Confucian Confusion , Yang efficiently introduces a circle of friends and colleagues whose locus is Molly (Ni Shu-Chun), a burned-out executive running a failing PR agency. The business, which primarily focuses on the country\u2019s cultural institutions, is propped up by Molly\u2019s buffoonish, wealthy husband, Akeem (Wang Bosen). Her employee and college chum, Qiqi (Chen Shiang-chyi), remains loyal to Molly and the company, which causes friction with her boyfriend Ming (Wang Wei-ming), another fellow classmate and middle-class striver, who believes that a career in the arts and financial stability are incompatible.

Sign Up The film\u2019s farcical plot is sparked in part by Akeem\u2019s scheming right-hand man, Larry (Danny Deng), who tries to get him to stop funding Molly\u2019s business by contributing to an ongoing rumor that Molly is having an affair. Little does Akeem know that Larry, whom he considers his best friend, has been actively pursuing Molly behind his back, while also conducting his own affair with Feng (Richie Li), a former employee of Molly\u2019s and an aspiring actress who has no compunction about using her sexuality to get ahead. The idea of \u201cconnections\u201d plays a key role in both A Confucian Confusion and Mahjong , whether that means business associates or simply access to money, because it essentially places a monetary value on interpersonal relationships. Larry, the most dishonorable character in A Confucian Confusion , proudly compares friendships to \u201clong-term investments\u201d when he\u2019s not trying to woo Molly with talk of how moved he was by her financial statements. Though Yang positions Larry as exceptionally selfish, all of the characters in A Confucian Confusion exist on the same continuum of egotism or hypocrisy, and every relationship is ultimately transactional: Molly needs Akeem\u2019s money to prop up her business, Qiqi needs Molly\u2019s company to stay afloat, and Larry needs Akeem to believe that he\u2019s working in his best interests so his deception stays concealed. Love and friendship are permanently interlinked with careerism and greed until they\u2019re indistinguishable from one another.

The film opens with Molly\u2019s old friend and foppish playwright client, Birdy (Wang Wei-ming), pompously extolling the value of artistic populism to a group of journalists. Birdy has turned his back on \u201cpostmodern abstraction\u201d and embraced comedy (a reference to Yang\u2019s own development with A Confucian Confusion ), claiming that, in a truly equal, democratic society, purchasing a ticket at the box office is the equivalent of voting. Meanwhile, Birdy combats accusations of plagiarizing a work by Molly\u2019s brother-in-law (Hung Hung, also the coauthor of the film\u2019s screenplay), a former romance novelist turned pretentious hermit writing gloomy treatises on society\u2019s failures. In Yang\u2019s eyes, both men are absurd figures with opposing temperaments: Birdy, a goof prone to histrionic fits at the slightest hint of struggle, and Hung Hung\u2019s unnamed character, a conceited, self-indulgent bore who can\u2019t communicate with anyone. Though the film ends with both men breaking out of their respective ruts, Yang refuses to side with either character\u2019s ideology: Neither Birdy\u2019s populist worldview nor the monastic creative ideals of Molly\u2019s brother-in-law are deemed the moral victor. Instead, Yang positions the two poles as a constant struggle between commercial appeal and personal principle that is doomed to last forever. Yang fills A Confucian Confusion with intertitles that present upcoming snippets of dialogue as if they\u2019re bits of modern Confucian wisdom, implying that banal conversation neatly stands in for philosophy. He also packs A Confucian Confusion with even more Western accouterments than Mahjong : T-shirts, logos, NBA games\u2014all of it screams Taipei as an international hub. But the city\u2019s identity, Yang argues, has become muddled in the process, and the new competitive spirit has sapped it of its sense of community. No one can trust Qiqi\u2019s sunny disposition, despite her utter sincerity, because it can just as easily be faked by someone who wants to steal something from a friend. Before Akeem becomes inconsolably jealous at the thought of Molly having an affair, he compares their open relationship to the one between China and Taiwan: \u201cone country, two systems.\u201d In A Confucian Confusion , everyone is both very earnest and completely full of it, befitting the nation\u2019s divided soul, a possible response to the question posed by Confucius that opens the film: \u201cWhat comes next after they are made rich?\u201d (Courtesy of Janus Films) Mahjong answers that question in a more nihilistic fashion: The film\u2019s back half is dominated by scenes of kidnapping, suicide, and a brutal murder, all done with future riches or maintaining wealth in mind. Yang\u2019s blunter approach here risks monotony, but only because his characters\u2019 desires are fairly narrow. His inclusion of European characters can be a mixed bag, with widely varying performances, but they undoubtedly provide a view into how native Taiwanese perceive Western interlopers. (\u201cIf this viewpoint strikes us as odd and oblique, I\u2019m sure that\u2019s no less the case when Asians see Asian characters in Western films,\u201d noted Jonathan Rosenbaum in 1997.) If Mahjong resembles a messy crime comedy, that\u2019s because it acutely portrays Taiwan as a messy, violent clash of languages and competing ideologies, all undergirded by the noxious shadow of global capitalism. Admittedly, A Confucian Confusion fares better, if only because Yang\u2019s satiric instincts more readily succeed in the film\u2019s strictly professional environments, given his own experience working in similar milieus in America. Yang and Hung Hung\u2019s sharp script contains stronger comedy and deeper characterizations, which helps tremendously with the satire, but it\u2019s worth noting that both films end on a comparably bittersweet note. In Mahjong , Luen-Luen and Marthe are reunited in a romantic embrace amid the chaos of Taipei\u2019s streets, and while Yang portrays the scene as a genuinely passionate moment, both remain permanently lost and unmoored, one in his home country and the other in her impulsively adopted one. Meanwhile, A Confucian Confusion ends with the majority of the film\u2019s couples fractured, including Qiqi and Ming, who frequently speak to each other like associates trying to keep a shaky merger afloat. The two lovingly agree they\u2019re better off apart, but just as they\u2019re about to exit each other\u2019s lives, they decide to give it one more go. Yang frames the scene like the optimistic end of a screwball romantic comedy, but with a dark implication: In this modern age, maybe a business relationship posing as a romantic one is a noble aspiration. All of Yang\u2019s films tread similar national-identity territory, but the comedic structure of A Confucian Confusion and Mahjong enabled him to be more overt with his feelings about the state of Taiwan. Near the end of Mahjong , Markus smugly tells Marthe, \u201cThe future of Western civilization lies right here\u2026. The 19th century was the glorious age of imperialism, right? Just wait till you see the 21st century.\u201d Yang\u2019s premature death was a blow to world cinema for many reasons, but chief among them is his inability to follow up on such prophetic words.
