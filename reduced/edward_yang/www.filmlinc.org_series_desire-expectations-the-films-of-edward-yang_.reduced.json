  "meta_description": "Featuring newly restored and rarely screened films from the pioneering filmmaker\u2019s profound body of work.\"Desire/Expectations: The Films of Edward Yang\" is a comprehensive retrospective honoring one of cinema\u2019s most celebrated and deeply missed surveyors of the human condition.",
  "main_content": "Taipei Story, Yi Yi, A Confucian Confusion, and A Brighter Summer Day (courtesy of Janus Films) Tickets $ 17 General Public $ 14 Students, Seniors, and Persons with Disabilities $ 12 Members A Brighter Summer Day and Yi Yi return to FLC theaters April 17-25! The films of Edward Yang (1947\u20132007) were among the first to capture the ethos of Taiwan\u2019s rapid modernization\u2014particularly Taipei urbanites adjusting to their global city\u2019s ever-evolving zeitgeist\u2014even as they exhibited a novelistic field of vision that superseded time and place. Born in Shanghai and brought to Taiwan by his family in 1949 after the end of the Chinese Civil War, Yang emerged in the early 1980s as a leading figure of the ascendant Taiwanese New Wave with his contribution to the seminal anthology film In Our Time (1982). He remained a cinematic guiding light of his country\u2019s first postwar generation up to his magnum opus, Yi Yi (2000, NYFF38). Grounding his films in a realist aesthetic\u2014perhaps partly owed to his formal training as a computer engineer\u2014Yang gracefully responded to the world\u2019s changes across seven expansive features, each one notable for their sprawling, unconventional narrative structures, effortlessly precise compositions, and largely nonprofessional casts that expressed a heartfelt, near-omniscient understanding of life on the small island nation. Likening any one of his films to a \u201cvery intimate letter to a very good friend,\u201d Yang defined the intricacies of interpersonal relationships (among different generations and classes) with a depth of storytelling and intimacy of style that call for multiple viewings to parse. The retrospective is occasioned by brand-new restorations of two of Yang\u2019s rarely screened works: Mahjong (1996, NYFF34), whose new 4K restoration will have its world premiere as part of the series; and A Confucian Confusion (1994), which was both an NYFF32 Main Slate selection and an NYFF60 Revivals selection. Well overdue for a rerelease, Yi Yi (2000, NYFF38), Yang\u2019s final and most renowned film, will receive multiple screenings throughout the series. In addition to the groundbreaking anthology In Our Time (1982), which revitalized Taiwanese narrative cinema in the 1980s and includes Yang\u2019s first work made for theatrical release, other highlights include several of Yang\u2019s seldom-screened films: That Day, on the Beach (1983), his first theatrical feature film and one of the greatest debuts of the 20th century; The Winter of 1905 (1982), directed by Yu Wei-cheng from Yang\u2019s sensitive script; and Yang\u2019s unfinished animated martial arts film The Wind (2002\u20132005), whose production was halted after his death. These films, in addition to Yang\u2019s widely beloved works such as A Brighter Summer Day (1991), Taipei Story (1985), and Terrorizers (1986), offer audiences the rare chance to experience on the big screen the breadth of Yang\u2019s work and his trajectory as an artist, from a screenwriter to his theatrical debut as a director to the projects leading up to his death that remain unfinished but hint at what could have been. The series comes more than a decade after the last retrospective of Yang\u2019s work in New York, which was also presented by Film at Lincoln Center in 2011. Presented with the support of Janus Films. Organized by Florence Almozini and Tyler Wilson. Acknowledgements: Kaili Peng and Kailidoscope Pictures; Taiwan Film and Audiovisual Institute Jump to: A Brighter Summer Day Edward Yang 1991 Taiwan 237 minutes Mandarin and Taiwanese with English subtitles 4K Restoration A deeply personal epic comparable in scope and impact to The Godfather movies and Sergio Leone\u2019s Once Upon a Time in America , Edward Yang\u2019s extraordinary memory film stretches tautly over four hours of screen time and more than 100 speaking parts. Yi Yi Edward Yang 2000 Taiwan 173 minutes Mandarin Chinese with English subtitles Winner of the Best Director Award at Cannes, Yi Yi would be remarkable if only for the nuanced performances, or for the delicacy of the narrative, or for the gentleness and affection with which Edward Yang considers his characters: Together, these ingredients make it both irresistible and overwhelming. An NYFF38 Main Slate selection. The Winter of 1905 Yu Wei-cheng 1982 Taiwan 90 minutes Mandarin with English subtitles Before he turned his attention to directing, Edward Yang contributed the screenplay to this rarely screened period piece starring legendary Hong Kong action director Tsui Hark ( Peking Opera Blues ) as the great Chinese artist and Buddhist monk Li Shutong, aka Master Hong. In Our Time + The Wind Tao Te-chen, Edward Yang, Ko I-cheng, Chang Yi 1982 Taiwan 110 minutes Mandarin with English subtitles 2K Restoration Edward Yang\u2019s first work made for theatrical release, Expectations , was presented as the second short of this anthology film which revitalized Taiwanese narrative cinema in the 1980s and established a break from decades of rigidly conservative movies entrenched in the local industry. Screening with Yang's unfinished final work The Wind . That Day, on the Beach Edward Yang 1983 Taiwan 166 minutes Hokkien, Mandarin, German, and English with English subtitles 2K Restoration Edward Yang\u2019s first theatrical feature film (which also marked the debut of the cinematographer Christopher Doyle) is a visually and emotionally arresting melodrama of fractured romance, disaffection, and the intergenerational breakdown felt across Taiwan in the 1980s. Taipei Story Edward Yang 1985 Taiwan 110 minutes Hokkien and Mandarin with English subtitles 4K Restoration Framed in precisely calibrated compositions of urban anonymity and featuring a nonprofessional cast that Edward Yang hoped would reflect the city as he and friends experienced it firsthand, Taipei Story is a psychologically rich character drama realized through the prism of social critique. Terrorizers Edward Yang 1986 Taiwan/Hong Kong 108 minutes Mandarin with English subtitles 2K Restoration A complexly layered, self-reflexive puzzle film, Terrorizers is at once Edward Yang\u2019s ultimate statement on the isolation of modern living and a road map through his own formidable creative process. A Confucian Confusion Edward Yang 1994 Taiwan 129 minutes Mandarin Chinese with English subtitles New 4K Restoration Though it signaled a shift in tone from his earlier, more dramatic films, the ambitious and incisive A Confucian Confusion finds Edward Yang once again searching for the soul of a country he no longer quite recognizes. An NYFF32 Main Slate and NYFF60 Revivals selection. Mahjong Edward Yang 1996 Taiwan 121 minutes English and Mandarin with English subtitles World Premiere of New 4K Restoration A screwball farce about the manipulation and lies baked into modern prosperity, Mahjong centers on a trendy nightspot in Taipei, where Edward Yang orchestrates the elaborate comings and goings of a raft of disparate characters. An NYFF34 Main Slate selection. Tickets on sale soon! $17 for the General Public; $14 for Students, Seniors, and Persons with Disabilities; and $12 for FLC Members .
