Deriv ation of a F unction for V elocity for F alling Ob jects with Non-Negligible Air Resistance Leonhard Nagel Novem ber 2021 Abstract F or many falling objects, air resistance can b e assumed to be negligible; however, this assumption is not a valid one to mak e in many cases. Thus, a function relating velocity to time, under consideration of drag, can b e used to better estimate the velocity of a falling object. In an idealized sense, two forces act upon a falling object: weight and drag. These two forces can be assumed to act in opposite direction to each other. This means that a simple equation for acceleration based on Newton\u2019s Second Law of Motion can be found, which can then be derived to yield an expression for velocity . As stated in the abstract, the goal of this paper is it to \ufb01nd a function relating velocity ( v ) to time ( t ) in terms of the mass of the object ( m ), gravitational acceleration ( g ) and the proportion- ality constant betw een velocity squared and drag ( z ). This paper assumes that the only two forces acting on the object are weight ( F G ) and drag ( F D ). To get the magnitude of these t wo forces, the following tw o equations are used, respectively. F G = mg F D = zv 2 Note that this paper accepts the common assumption that drag is proportional to the square of the velocity . The prop ortionalit y constant is said to be equal to the following, whereby C D is the drag coe\ufb03cient, \u03c1 is the density of the medium and A is the reference area of the body. z = C D A\u03c1 2 Newton\u2019s Second Law of Motion can be stated as the following relationship of net force ( F net ), mass ( m ), and acceleration ( a ). F net = ma \u21d0 \u21d2 a = F net m In the case of this falling object, drag and weight act on it in opposite directions. Thus, net force equals the following. (Note: for the purposes of this calculation, moving in a positive direction is considered to be moving towards the surface of the earth.) F net = F G \u2212 F D F G and F D can now also be substituted with their respective formulae. F net = mg \u2212 zv 2 This expression can now be substituted into Newton\u2019s Second Law. a = mg \u2212 zv 2 m a can thereby be rewritten as the derivativ e of v with respect to t , d v d t , which yields the following di\ufb00erential equation. d v d t = mg \u2212 zv 2 m This di\ufb00erential equation is considered to be separable, which means that it is helpful to mov e all terms involving v to the left side, while leaving all other terms on the other. After moving the 1 terms, the left side can be integrated with respect to v and the right side can be integrated with respect to t . Z 1 mg \u2212 zv 2 d v = Z 1 m d t The integral on the right-hand side can be ev aluated with relative ease. T o evaluate the integral on the left-hand side, 1 mg can be \ufb01rstly factored out of the fraction and placed in front of the integral, as it is a constant. 1 mg Z 1 1 \u2212 z mg v 2 d v = t m The z mg term in the denominator of the fraction in the integral can be combined into the v 2 term to yield the following. 1 mg Z 1 1 \u2212 ( v q z mg ) 2 d v = t m The integral on the right-hand side can be simpli\ufb01ed by performing a u -substitution, whereby the function u is de\ufb01ned as u = q z mg v . The derivative of this function can be found using the power rule. d u d v = d d v r z mg v = 1 \u00b7 r z mg v 1 \u2212 1 = r z mg An expression for d u can be found by rearranging the equation. d u d v = r z mg \u21d0 \u21d2 d u = r z mg d v In the oringinal equation, the fraction inside the integral can be multiplied by p mg z \u00b7 q z mg . 1 mg Z 1 1 \u2212 ( v q z mg ) 2 \u00b7 r mg z \u00b7 r z mg d v = t m In this equation, v q z mg can be substituted by u , as per de\ufb01nition of u . q z mg d v can be substituted with d u , as per a relationship established two equations ago. The p mg z , as a constant, can be placed in front of the integral and com bined with 1 mg . 1 \u221a zmg Z 1 1 \u2212 u 2 d u = t m The following identit y can now be used to evaluate the in tegral on the left-hand side, whereby x \u2208 R\u29f9 { 1 , \u2212 1 } . d d x tanh \u2212 1 ( x ) = 1 1 \u2212 x 2 \u21d0 \u21d2 Z 1 1 \u2212 x 2 d x = tanh \u2212 1 ( x ) Thus, using the identity to solv e the integral, substituting u for x , will yield the following expression. 1 \u221a zmg \u00b7 tanh \u2212 1 ( u ) = t m q z mg v can be substituted for u , and the fraction can be recombined. tanh \u2212 1 ( q z mg v ) \u221a zmg = t m Both sides can now be multiplied by \u221a zmg , after which the hyperbolic tangent function can also applied to both sides. v r z mg = tanh( r zg m t ) Finally , both sides are multiplied by p mg z to yield an expression for v as a function of t . v ( t ) = r mg z tanh( r zg m t ) 2 ResearchGate has not been able to resolve any citations for this publication.
