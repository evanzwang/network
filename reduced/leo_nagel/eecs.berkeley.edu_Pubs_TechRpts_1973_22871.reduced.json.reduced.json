Pederson EECS Department, University of California, Berkeley Technical Report No. UCB/ERL M382 , 1973 http://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/1973/ERL-m-382.pdf A new circuit simulation program, SPICE, is described. The simulation capabilities of nonlinear dc analysis, small signal analysis, and nonlinear transient analysis are combined in a nodal analysis program to yield a reasonably general purpose electronic circuit simulation program. Particular emphasis is placed upon the circuit models for the BJT and the FET which are implemented in SPICE.
