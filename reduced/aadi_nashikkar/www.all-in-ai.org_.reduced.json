  "main_content": "About Us The goal of All In AI is to inspire a diverse community of students to consider a future in AI. The course seeks to empower students with the acquisition of technical knowledge and project-based application. All In AI supports instruction in high school classes, clubs, and career fairs. Options for a summer camp and online course are also in development. Peer-to-peer learning is part of the process, where students who have already taken the course can give back, teaching the course in the future. The curriculum was created by students, for students, and taught by students. A project-based focus ensures students not only learn skills, but also how to apply them. Teachers with programming experience ensure students are able to experience challenges, without a fear of failure Services All In AI seeks to provide a multitude of learning opportunities for students to access the content. What started as a small in-person learning experience is quickly expanding to offerings that ensure that any student in any location is able to learn the skills for entry into AI Live Instruction All in AI offers in-person instruction opportunities for groups or clubs. We work primarily with high schools, but contact us regardless! Summer Coding Camp All In AI is excited to announce the return of the summer coding camp for 2024. This camp will be a week long and will be open to all students in the Colorado Springs area. Free Educator Toolkit All In AI's original focus on in-person instruction will be expanding with the creation of an educator's tool kit, so teachers can bring AI to their classrooms. Growth Opportunities Once completing the program, All In AI will be developing a talent accelerator program for exploration of additonal content in the AI field. Call To Action Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence are estimated to contribute 16 trillion dollars to the global economy in the next 10 years. All in AI seeks to bring introductory knowledge and skills to all students, including underrepresented student populations, in order to increase access to this emerging global field.
