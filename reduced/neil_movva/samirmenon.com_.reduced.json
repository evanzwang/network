I previously co-founded Blyss with Neil Movva . We worked on running LLMs in hardware enclaves, and on an SDK for private information retrieval. Before that, I was a software engineer at Yubico , where I worked on secure device manufacturing and programming. I've also done research in homomorphic encryption and private information retrieval.

Wu Oakland (IEEE S&P) 2022 Background I got my B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science in 2019 from Stanford University; my tracks were Systems and Computer & Network Security. While there, I was a TA for Prof. Dan Boneh's CS 255 (cryptography) and CS 251 (blockchain) classes. I also did research in the Applied Cryptography group on speeding up lattice-based SNARKs .",
