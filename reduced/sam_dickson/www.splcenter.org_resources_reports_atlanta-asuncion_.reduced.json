Sam Dickson\u2019s right-wing political activities began in high school, when he teamed up with local Golderwaterites. Since then, the Atlanta white supremacist and mini-real estate mogul (see How Sam Dickson Got Rich ) has been tied to numerous extremist groups and movements in the U.S. and around the world, from major Holocaust denial organizations to the Ku Klux Klan he frequently represented in court. During the Cold War, Dickson was a member of the World Anti-Communist League, an international collection of right-wingers steeped in white supremacism and anti-Semitism. These tendencies became overt under the leadership of Dickson associate and British-born neo-Nazi Roger Pearson, who chaired the league in 1978-79. Pearson recruited former Nazis and allied the organization with every anti-Communist nation except one: Israel. In 1979, Dickson, as an American delegate to the league\u2019s conference in Asunci\u00f3n, Paraguay, explained the group\u2019s anomalous support for the Palestine Liberation Organization to The Washington Post : \u201cIsrael has made herself repugnant\u2026 . Occasionally, one has to decide that the enemy of mine enemy is not my friend.\u201d According to the Post , among those attending the 1979 conference were \u201cformer Nazi SS officers, two neo-fascists from Italy reportedly wanted for terrorist acts, members of Alpha 66, a right-wing Cuban exile group, and Pedro Ibanez Ojeda, who attended as Chilean President Augusto Pinochet\u2019s personal envoy.\u201d The Latin American wing of the league, which hosted the event, grew out of the remnants of Los Tecos, a World War II fascist group. After the Cold War, communism disappeared from Dickson\u2019s enemies list. His longstanding obsession with race filled the vacuum. He now summarizes his philosophy as one of \u201cracial nationalism\u201d \u2014 \u201cMy race is my nation.\u201d This is lens through which Dickson views all of American and even world history. Every war, every technological advance, every economic trend is interpreted solely through its impact on the white race. The automobile, for example, is a tragic development for Dickson because it allowed whites to escape the cities and thus \u201cdelay confronting\u201d the race issue. Dickson has been on intimate terms with the leading lights of the racial nationalist movement. When movement theorist Revilo Oliver died in 1994, Dickson performed master of ceremonies duties at a memorial symposium put on in his honor by the National Alliance, a leading neo-Nazi group. Dickson paid homage to Oliver in part by leading the small audience in song, including off-key versions of \u201cFinlandia\u201d and \u201cAuld Lang Syne.\u201d The Georgian\u2019s love of European nationalist song is heartfelt, and has led David Duke to publicly gush, \u201cHe can sing all of the songs from our heritage!\u201d Dickson\u2019s involvement with Holocaust denial extends beyond his respect for Oliver, who coined the term \u201cHolohoax.\u201d In 1989, Historical Review Press, a purveyor of Nazi books, music and memorabilia linked to British Holocaust denier David Irving, was incorporated under Dickson\u2019s name. (Irving is known to have stayed at Dickson\u2019s Key West home while avoiding criminal charges in Europe.) Dickson also writes for the Journal of Historical Review , another journal specializing in Holocaust denial. Dickson\u2019s most notable contribution to the Review is the 1987 essay, \u201cShattering the Icon of Abraham Lincoln,\u201d which argues that Lincoln was an atheistic and brutal dictator who forced an unnecessary war on a country that did not want or need one. The article has been distributed widely on the Internet and is frequently referenced by neo-Confederate and other far-right groups in discussions of Lincoln. \u201cThere appears to be no logical reason,\u201d writes Dickson in the essay, \u201cwhy [the United States] could not have [remained half slave, half free] given responsible leadership and good will on both sides, until slavery was eliminated by the progress of technology.\u201d",
