Listen to more stories on the Noa app. T he Schweitzer brothers see John Gonsalves everywhere now. In the small towns on the eastern tip of Hawaii\u2019s Big Island, everyone knows everyone, and if you\u2019re not from here, you might never fit in. Everywhere the brothers go, they see Gonsalves\u2019s truck. He\u2019s a small man with a scraggly beard, and runs a business building fences on properties up and down the coast. Rumor has it the business isn\u2019t doing so well. Rumor also has it he funded that business with the reward money he took for sending the Schweitzer brothers to jail. Sometimes, at traffic lights or in parking lots, Gonsalves sees them too. On these occasions, he smiles a little. Sometimes he even waves. The brothers can\u2019t believe it. He\u2019s waving? They turn and head in the other direction, fast. If they didn\u2019t leave, they have no idea what they might say to the man they believe ruined their lives. Albert Ian Schweitzer is 52 now\u2014short and wide and muscular, with Popeye forearms, a deep tan, and a close-cropped, graying buzz cut. He walks with the rugged, unfluid strides of a guy who spends most of his time at the gym, which is an accurate if incomplete way of describing how he\u2019s spent the past 25 years of his life. Until January, he was lifting weights during every available hour in a federal prison yard in Arizona. Now he is back home, on the porch of his brother\u2019s house, his nieces milling around him. In idle moments, Ian, who goes by his middle name, seems to stare at his surroundings, as if trying to focus. \u201cThree months ago I was sitting in a prison cell, you know?\u201d he said when I visited in April. \u201cI can\u2019t even wrap my head around it.\u201d He and his brother, Shawn\u2014also muscle-bound but taller and four years younger\u2014are dealing with the damage of the past several decades. Ian is trying to figure out how to be free after so much time. Shawn, after serving more than a year, kept on living in the area, enduring decades of stares, his employment prospects grim, the stigma surrounding him seeping out and tainting his wife and children. Downtown Hilo Everyone had been convinced that the brothers were the culprits in one of the most notorious criminal cases in the modern history of Hawaii: the rape and murder of a 23-year-old woman named Dana Ireland on Christmas Eve, 1991. At the time, Ian was 20 and Shawn was 16. Neither had a record, and their parents were law-abiding citizens. For three years, no one came to them to talk about this case. But in 1994, the police, acting on a tip, began investigating them both, latching on to a theory that implicated them even when the physical evidence\u2014the blood, the semen, the tire tracks\u2014all pointed elsewhere. Wrongful convictions can result from any number of cascading errors, blatant oversights, and outright slipups\u2014some conscious and deliberate, some structural and circumstantial. Over 32 years, the investigation and prosecutions of the Schweitzers seem to have incorporated every possible one of them. There was intense media attention putting pressure on police to make an arrest\u2014 the \u201cdead white girl\u201d phenomenon . There was cultural bias against Native Hawaiians like the Schweitzers\u2014the legacy, well known to Hawaiians, of lynchings of native men for alleged attacks on white women. There was investigative tunnel vision\u2014going after the Schweitzer brothers even after the facts failed to support that case. There was blind faith in jailhouse informants\u2014a slew of them, all hoping for special favors from prosecutors in return for their testimony. There was junk science\u2014about teeth marks, and tire treads. There even may have been prosecutorial misconduct\u2014a state lawyer misleading a judge about the outcome of one of the brothers\u2019 polygraph tests. From the November 2022 issue: Jake Tapper on a Philadelphia teenager and the empty promise of the Sixth Amendment Now that Ian has been exonerated, he needs to reacclimate to life in the world. He had to get a driver\u2019s license and learn how to use a smartphone. He needs to get comfortable around people again. These towns were small enough already. For decades the Schweitzers were the area\u2019s greatest villains; now they run into people and those people are nice. At the market and at restaurants, they congratulate Ian and ask if they can give him a hug. It\u2019s weird. He can\u2019t help but think: Where were those people for the past 30 years? But he knows there are others out there too\u2014people who benefited from accusing him of a crime they knew he hadn\u2019t committed. Chief among them is John Gonsalves. As our conversation meandered over a sunny afternoon, Ian allowed himself to wonder about Gonsalves. What must it be like for him now, to know that the lie didn\u2019t hold? If the brothers ever did confront him, what would he say? T he place where Dana Ireland\u2019s body was found is less than a half-hour drive from the Schweitzer family\u2019s home, a rundown ranch house in a development called Hawaiian Beaches enshrouded by low palm trees and lush, tropical ferns. The homes are built close enough to one another that you can see and hear most anything your neighbor is up to. The Schweitzer family always stood out here. Ian and Shawn\u2019s parents, Jerry and Linda Schweitzer, moved to the sleepy east coast of the Big Island in the 1970s from the more populated island of Oahu, where Jerry owned an auto body shop. Linda found work at a bank and later in the local prosecutor\u2019s office, as a victim counselor. Other families in the subdivision were on public assistance; the Schweitzers didn\u2019t need that. Ian and Shawn were the kids whose parents sprang for equipment for the whole little league so that everyone could afford to play. Ian saved enough money from his paper route to buy his own car\u2014a used Volkswagen Beetle\u2014which he fixed up himself before he was old enough to drive it. The Schweitzers \u201cjust had a little more than the next person,\u201d Ian told me. \u201cI think we were hated on right from the gate.\u201d One night in June 1991, Linda and Jerry found themselves in a confrontation with their across-the-road neighbor, a known drug dealer named Timmy Gonsalves. Timmy was in his mid-20s, and had friends going in and out of his house at all hours. Some of Timmy\u2019s younger cousins went to the same high school as Shawn. Both families were Hawaiian with mixed ancestry: The Gonsalveses came from Puerto Rico, while the Schweitzer brothers have Portuguese and German ancestors (hence their last name). Linda and Jerry often heard screaming and loud music from Timmy\u2019s house, which the police would raid now and then. Sometimes, Linda and Jerry were the ones who called the cops. Across the street from the Schweitzers\u2019 home (left) is the house where Timmy Gonsalves used to live (right) . On this particular night, Timmy stood in front of their house and started yelling, goading the Schweitzers to \u201ccome to the roadway and fight,\u201d according to a police report filed that night. Once Linda told the officer that the conflict had been going on for years, Timmy was charged with harassment. An encore performance took place a few months later; Timmy and his cousin Wayne threw rocks onto the Schweitzers\u2019 roof and beer cans at their garage. Linda tape-recorded that confrontation for the police, who heard the cousins threatening her and her family. This time, both Gonsalveses were charged with harassment. No one characterized what was happening as anything deeper than an everyday beef between neighbors. It would come to seem significant to the Schweitzers\u2014something that could, perhaps, explain the unexplainable\u2014only later, after a young white woman, visiting from the mainland, was raped and left dying on Christmas Eve, and the police were desperate for leads. D ana Ireland was just out of college when she came to Hawaii from Virginia for an extended stay in October 1991. Dana\u2019s older sister, Sandra, had been living on the east coast of the Big Island, and their parents came to join the sisters for the holidays. That area, south of Hilo, the county seat, is not one of the most obvious tourist destinations for mainlanders, but it\u2019s beautiful, with secluded beaches and fishing spots known only to the locals. The Irelands rented a place in a subdivision called Vacationland, a sleepy neighborhood joined by heavily forested dirt roads that are best traveled by bicycle. Dana biked on her own a lot. On the afternoon of Christmas Eve, while her parents were getting dinner ready, she biked to a friend\u2019s house. She was seen on the way back passing the warm springs in Kapoho and open fields of lava flows. She never made it home. Just before 5:30 p.m., someone found Ireland\u2019s bike in the brush by the side of a road and called the police. At 5:47 p.m., someone else called the police about an injured girl in Wa\u2018awa\u2018a, a remote neighborhood several miles away. A woman making dinner in her cottage had heard an engine gunning, and then muted screams for help. She walked out to a beach-access road and saw Ireland on the ground, bleeding, her denim shorts wrapped around her ankles, her shirt pulled up to her shoulders. Wa\u2018awa\u2018a had no electricity or phone service. Flagging down a passing car on the road to ask for help took the woman almost an hour. An ambulance didn\u2019t make it down the rutted dirt road until almost 7. Dana Ireland died at Hilo Hospital overnight. The entire state of Hawaii seemed to erupt in outrage. A young woman raped and killed on Christmas Eve. A killer on the loose. The police spent much of 1992 canvassing the area, interviewing longtime residents\u2014many of whom were caught up in trouble of some sort, and looking for a way out. One was a man named Frank Pauline Jr., who happened to be a member of the Gonsalves family. Timmy Gonsalves, the Schweitzer family\u2019s angry neighbor, was his cousin. On March 17, an anonymous tip led the police to question Pauline about Ireland. He supplied as his alibi a Christmas Eve party at his family\u2019s house. And then he gave them something more: He said he\u2019d been at a local park just a week earlier and had overheard someone\u2014he said he didn\u2019t know who\u2014yelling at Ian Schweitzer, accusing him of raping and murdering Ireland. Ian and Shawn both have said they knew of Pauline but never spent time with him. They say they have no idea why he brought up Ian\u2019s name that day. But it wouldn\u2019t be the last time he did. Pauline had established himself as, in the words of the prosecutor working the Ireland case, a \u201cwalking crime wave.\u201d In February 1993, police picked up Pauline for questioning in a burglary case and again asked him about the Ireland murder. This time he said he knew nothing about it but would keep his ears open for information. The cop applied pressure by telling Pauline that some people said he was the killer himself. \u201cYeah, people like to blame me,\u201d Pauline replied. Then, in July, Pauline was arrested and charged with the rape of a different woman. And a month later, prosecutors mounted what at the time was called the largest cocaine-trafficking case in the Big Island\u2019s history against three of Pauline\u2019s close relatives: his cousin Timmy; his mother, Pat Pauline; and a half-brother, John Gonsalves, whom the indictment described as \u201ca major distributor of cocaine.\u201d Practically the entire Gonsalves family was in trouble, just as the Ireland family was pushing officials to make an arrest in Dana\u2019s murder. In August 1993, her parents wrote open letters accusing prosecutors of \u201ctimidness\u201d: \u201cWe believe the police know the identities of the perpetrators,\u201d they declared in one. \u201cThere must be those who can supply the evidence the police need.\u201d The family offered a $25,000 reward for information leading to a conviction. In December 1993, a tipster told police that Pauline was saying he and a group including two brothers who were not the Schweitzers took part in the rape and murder. Those other brothers were questioned and polygraphed and eventually excluded as suspects. The following May, John Gonsalves\u2014out on a $10,000 bail but still facing charges for the cocaine case\u2014called the police and claimed that Pauline had witnessed the attack. By now, Pauline had established himself as, in the words of the prosecutor working the Ireland case, a \u201c walking crime wave .\u201d In 1994 he\u2019d started a 10-year prison sentence for the other rape case when he gave his courtroom guards the slip, fleeing to Honolulu for a weekend before the cops tracked him down. Now he was behind bars again. And this time, when the police met with Pauline in prison to talk again about the Ireland case, he put it all on the Schweitzer brothers. He said that he had been along for the ride in the back of the Schweitzer brothers\u2019 car that Christmas Eve when Ian, high on crack, ran the girl over, loaded her into the trunk, drove around with her for 10 or 15 minutes, and then pulled over and raped her. He mentioned Ireland being beaten with a tire iron. He insisted that Ian was the ringleader, Shawn was following Ian\u2019s directions, and he, Pauline, was just a witness. The police interviewed a few people who thought that Shawn was harmless, just a kid, but had more to say about Ian. A woman who\u2019d once dated Wayne Gonsalves (brother to John and half-brother to Pauline, and the one who\u2019d thrown beer cans at the Schweitzers\u2019 garage) told police that Ian was into coke, something Ian has always denied. Never mind that Ian and Shawn said they had never partied with any Gonsalves family member. Never mind that the Gonsalveses seemed engaged in a slow-burning conflict with Ian and Shawn\u2019s parents. The police took the rumors and, when all their other leads fell away, ran with them. Case files and a photograph of Ireland The area where Ireland\u2019s body was found Over the next two years, Pauline would speak with the police at least seven times about the murder. The details changed each time. First they were driving a friend\u2019s blue pickup truck, then a VW Bug. (The Schweitzers have owned various VWs over the years; Ian has always maintained that his only remote connection to the Gonsalves family was that he and Wayne occasionally traded VW parts.) Pauline had trouble saying exactly where they supposedly first saw Ireland, or where she was run over. The roles each of them allegedly played in the rape and murder seemed strangely fluid. And certain obvious details seemed to escape him. In June, he said that, on orders from Ian, he\u2019d hit Ireland with a tire iron, and yet he did not remember what she looked like, apart from the \u201cblood coming out of her eyes, her mouth, and her nose.\u201d The police let Pauline talk, knowing that the story implicated him more than he seemed to understand. He was focused on what he would get in return, continually making demands to improve his lot in jail. Sure enough, even after failing a polygraph, Pauline got some benefits\u2014additional phone calls to his girlfriend, promises of special visitation rights, a transfer to a more desirable prison. John Gonsalves would benefit from his cooperation too: He and the other family members received deals in their pending cocaine case, and late in 1994, Gonsalves was sentenced to only probation. All he had to do, it seemed, was get his brother to insert himself in one of the most high-profile murder cases in modern Hawaii history. A simple narrative locked into place: Bad local boys, all tied up with drugs, all the same, had gang-raped and killed the white girl. The police seized the Schweitzers\u2019 car\u2014a VW they\u2019d bought a couple of years earlier\u2014and interviewed Shawn, who had by then graduated from high school and was already settling down with his childhood sweetheart. A few days later, officers spoke with Ian on Kauai, where he\u2019d found a job as a nurse at a hospital. Both brothers were stunned and denied everything, but Ian was especially indignant. When asked why Pauline would point to him, he said that he could not think like Pauline or his family\u2014that he could not drop his mentality down to their level. \u201cThe kid got a lot of nerve,\u201d Ian said. By early 1995, Pauline\u2019s story leaked out into the news. But the more the media learned about Pauline, the less reliable he seemed. Even Pauline\u2019s own grandmother had once told a state investigator that he was \u201ca liar, a thief, and spoiled little brat.\u201d \u201cThe Ireland slaying case,\u201d a columnist for the Hawaii Tribune-Herald wrote, \u201cnow rests on the memory of a man whose attorney once described him as so drunk and loaded on cocaine that he did not remember the 1993 rape incident that took him to prison.\u201d And when Pauline himself was interviewed by reporters, he was happy to acknowledge that he\u2019d come forward only at the suggestion of his brother John Gonsalves. Gonsalves did his part to reinforce Pauline\u2019s narrative. He told police he saw the Schweitzer brothers pull up to the party his family threw on Christmas Eve, the night Ireland was killed. The brothers, he said, were driving a VW Bug Ian had just bought. But the front end of the car was damaged, and the guys didn\u2019t seem happy about it. The Schweitzers disputed everything. They said they hadn\u2019t even owned that car on Christmas Eve\u2014and they produced paperwork to show that Ian had bought it later. Besides, they said they\u2019d never be caught dead at a Gonsalves party. \u201cNever associated with him once. Never,\u201d Ian told me, referring to Pauline. \u201cHe said what he said to save John Gonsalves and his mom from doing prison time.\u201d But to the police, a simple narrative locked into place: Bad local boys, all tied up with drugs, all the same, had gang-raped and killed the white girl. That didn\u2019t change even when Pauline walked his story back. He seems to have belatedly realized that volunteering himself as a participant, even a minor one, in the Ireland killing wouldn\u2019t just get him favors in prison\u2014it might get him a new conviction too. With each interview, he\u2019d tried to cast Ian as the coked-up instigator and himself and Shawn as cowed underlings. But of course, saying that he\u2019d hit Dana Ireland with a tire iron, even under orders, was hardly a good look. On April 22, 1995, Pauline said that, actually, his brother Wayne was the one who did it. The police weren\u2019t biting. On July 6, 1996, he completely recanted, saying he\u2019d told the police what they wanted to hear, that his story about the Schweitzer brothers was completely made-up\u2014that John Gonsalves had struck a deal with prosecutors to persuade Pauline to talk with them about the Ireland case in exchange for them dropping his own drug charges. The police were facing time pressure. The statute of limitations on two of the charges\u2014kidnapping and sexual assault\u2014was approaching. (Prosecutors had more time to bring a murder charge but feared it would be harder to prove, because Ireland had been alive when she was left on the road.) \u201cI have now lost faith in the Hawaii County justice system,\u201d John Ireland fumed in another letter to a Hawaii paper, \u201cand I am now certain that those responsible for Dana\u2019s violent murder will never be brought to justice.\u201d Pauline was indicted in July 1997. Three months later, the Schweitzer brothers were arrested and indicted too. By early 2000, both Pauline and Ian would be convicted of all three charges. Shawn, who by April of that year had spent two stints in prison for a total of 16 months, was offered a chance to plead guilty to kidnapping and manslaughter in exchange for time served. His parents and Ian encouraged him to take the deal. It wasn\u2019t the truth. But Shawn had a wife and three young children. And the prosecutors were two for two. \u201cI thought, going into this, that there\u2019s no way that the justice system was going to do this to us,\u201d Shawn told me. \u201cThis whole scenario is so ridiculous that somebody\u2019s got to be bound to see that this is wrong, you know? And I believed that all the way up until I see my brother get convicted.\u201d Shawn took the deal, and Ian went to prison. In the eyes of the court and the world and everyone at home, Pauline and the Schweitzer brothers were murderers. O nce upon a time, Ken Lawson was a high-powered criminal-defense attorney in Cincinnati. Lawson spent the 1990s working police-misconduct cases, civil-rights cases\u2014change-the-world cases\u2014and representing star clients such as Deion Sanders . He had a mansion, a motorcycle, and a yacht. He had a wife and five kids, and a career that seemed unstoppable. At the height of his success, he ran an ad in the Yellow Pages calling himself the \u201cjunk yard dog of justice.\u201d Then it all fell apart. He\u2019d started drinking, and after he tore a rotator cuff at the gym, he got addicted to painkillers\u2014first Percodan from a doctor, and next OxyContin obtained through a client, until the habit cost him $1,000 a day. Very quickly Lawson destroyed nearly everything he\u2019d built. He was disbarred and spent almost two years in prison on a federal drug charge. His wife and family had moved to Hawaii, and after his release he moved into a halfway house on Oahu. Lawson was starting his life over again. He couldn\u2019t practice law, but he was invited to speak to some classes at the University of Hawaii\u2019s law school. And through a connection there, he became a clerk for Hawaii\u2019s Innocence Project, a nonprofit dedicated to exonerating the wrongly convicted. That\u2019s where he learned about Ian Schweitzer. The prosecutors\u2019 case had another glaring flaw\u2014a failure to get a DNA match. Lawson\u2019s background in misconduct cases gave him a fluency in the way that investigations go awry, the tunnel vision that can take over. He saw how all three men were presumed guilty before any were tried. Homemade Wanted: Dead posters with the Schweitzer brothers\u2019 faces peppered the streets of Hilo. A local author wrote Murder in Paradise\u2014 a true-crime book about how the police finally got the killers. The brothers had a hard time hanging on to lawyers: Every time they tried to hire one, the prosecutor\u2019s office would file a motion to have that lawyer conflicted out, based on involvement with the witnesses they planned to call. That witness list kept growing as more and more people implicated the Schweitzers, many of them in exchange for having their own legal troubles or prison conditions eased. Lawson saw in the files how everyone in the Pauline-Gonsalves circle recognized that getting the police to focus on Ian and Shawn was a way to get them off their own back. Lawson zeroed in on the VW. He saw an engineer\u2019s report saying a VW Bug\u2019s bumper was too wide to make the damage seen on Dana Ireland\u2019s bike\u2014nor could a VW\u2019s low-sloping front end have directly caused Ireland\u2019s injuries. \u201cIf you go through the police reports, day by day, step by step,\u201d Lawson told me, \u201cyou\u2019ll see there ain\u2019t nobody talking about Volkswagens at all for three years,\u201d until Pauline changed his story to bring up the model of the Schweitzers\u2019 car. The police were first looking for a small blue pickup truck, and then a tan van. Lawson couldn\u2019t understand why the VW wasn\u2019t more of an issue at Ian\u2019s trial. \u201cBased on the tread box and the tire distance, Ian would have had to customize and stretch the Volkswagen out, commit the crime, and then bunch it back to its normal size when the police came and seized it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just physically impossible.\u201d The prosecutors\u2019 case had another glaring flaw\u2014a failure to get a DNA match. In October 1998, an independent expert tested Ireland\u2019s vaginal swab and the hospital gurney sheet that she was transported on. The sperm found on both items did not match any of the three men charged with her rape and murder. On October 20, the prosecutor dropped charges against the Schweitzers. But within months there were whispers that they\u2019d soon be reindicted. Ireland\u2019s family, members of Congress, the governor, the public\u2014all wanted the case resolved. \u201cYou can see the change,\u201d Lawson told me. \u201c Rather than seek justice, we need a conviction . They knew the witnesses were lying, but they wanted the conviction anyway.\u201d Once the DNA test came back negative, they went in another direction. \u201cThat\u2019s when they go out and get the informant testimony.\u201d And in May 1999, the reindictment came along with a new star witness: a fellow inmate of Ian\u2019s named Michael Ortiz, who said Ian had confessed to the murder. For the Schweitzers, Michael Ortiz\u2019s arrival in the case is further proof that John Gonsalves was the puppet master behind everything. Ortiz isn\u2019t a Gonsalves. But his ex-girlfriend, the mother of his child, was married to one: John Gonsalves himself. Gonsalves seemed so determined to follow through even after Pauline recanted that he testified against Pauline at his trial in 1999, again telling the story that Pauline now was saying was fiction. \u201cHe told me that he and Ian and Shawn was driving,\u201d Gonsalves said, \u201cand they saw this girl on a bike, and they were giving her gestures, and when she refused, Ian got all mad \u2026 He went and banged the girl. He ran over her, supposedly ran over her again, and they grabbed her and took her.\u201d Left: John Gonsalves at Frank Pauline\u2019s trial. Right: Pauline. (William Ing/AP) On the stand, Gonsalves insisted that he wasn\u2019t throwing his own brother under the bus to get a deal for himself. \u201cIn Hilo, everybody talks that I turned my brother in. I\u2019d never do that. I would never sell my brother out. But the truth is the truth,\u201d he said, \u201cand I feel for the family.\u201d Gonsalves\u2019s testimony, along with Ortiz\u2019s, clinched the prosecution\u2019s case, giving the jury more of a reason to ignore the lack of DNA evidence. At trial, the prosecutors explained away the fact that the DNA didn\u2019t match any of the three accused men by arguing that the semen must have been from a mysterious fourth participant in the killing\u2014they called him \u201cUnknown Male No. 1\u201d\u2014and that it must have \u201cmasked\u201d semen from the Schweitzers or Pauline. After Pauline was convicted, it became clear what else Gonsalves had been expecting from his testimony. He wrote the Ireland family a long letter asking for the $25,000 in reward money. \u201cI feel the reward should be released to me,\u201d Gonsalves wrote. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for me, none of this would have been settled.\u201d He anticipated that the Irelands might not want his testimony in the two upcoming trials against Ian and Shawn to be tainted by the fact that he\u2019d received the reward. So he proposed an elegant work-around, suggesting they put the money \u201cunder my aunty\u2019s name.\u201d That way, he wrote, \u201cthere would be no proof that I got it.\u201d He got the money. T he first few years were the worst for Ian. His appeals lawyer wouldn\u2019t even take his calls. In time, he studied to be a paralegal and got a relatively easy work assignment in the recreation area (though in Arizona that meant some 110-degree days). As he got older, the younger guys started to call him \u201cUncle.\u201d At home, Shawn was free, but for years he couldn\u2019t get a job. \u201cPeople I\u2019ve known my whole life just kind of laughed and said, \u2018Shawn, I cannot help you. There\u2019s no way my boss could let me hire you.\u2019\u201d He got a commercial driver\u2019s license and was hired by a construction company that fired him as soon as they learned who he was. \u201cEverybody read the paper.\u201d Shawn and his wife and kids moved in with his in-laws to save money. They\u2019ve never left. He finally found a road-maintenance job, and then a construction job where the boss gave him a chance. He\u2019s been working there ever since. The stigma has trickled down to his children. When one of his daughters was in eighth grade, her teacher assigned her class Murder in Paradise , the true-crime book. After another girl called Shawn a rapist, a fight broke out, and his daughter was suspended for five days. \u201cSuspended for defending her dad,\u201d he said. \u201cFor a long time, I was angry\u2014an angry person,\u201d Shawn said. \u201cAnd you know, you had people like John Gonsalves, waving at you and throwing it in your face.\u201d Shawn swears he wasn\u2019t out looking for Gonsalves, but there he was. \u201cLike, every morning when I would go to work, I would pass him, you know? Whatever he was doing, he would wave\u2014for years. I was just like, this guy\u2014something\u2019s wrong in his brain.\u201d Ian says Pauline once wrote to him\u2014a letter apologizing for making up the story about him and Shawn. They had a run-in around 2005, when for a short time they both were in the same Mississippi prison. Pauline was trying to appeal. \u201cHe said something like, \u2018I\u2019m sorry, and I\u2019m working on getting you off,\u2019\u201d Ian remembered. \u201cI wanted to beat him up.\u201d Pauline would never get out. On April 27, 2015\u2014his 42nd birthday\u2014he was hit with a rock on the back of the head during a fight in the yard of a New Mexico prison. He died from his injuries. Afterward, Pauline\u2019s mother, Pat, came to Ian\u2019s parents\u2019 home. Jerry and Linda Schweitzer had been crushed, Ian told me, \u201cfinancially and mentally\u201d by their sons\u2019 convictions. Pat started to speak to Jerry: \u201cI just want to say sorry for ruining your family and your sons\u2019 lives.\u201d She asked if he and Linda could \u201cfind it in your heart to forgive us, because we\u2019re getting really bad luck.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sure he was stunned,\u201d Ian said of his father. \u201cBut his exact words were \u2018The day my son walks out of prison, that\u2019s the day I can start to forgive you.\u2019\u201d A fter Ken Lawson joined the Hawaii Innocence Project , he spent years examining how flimsy the government\u2019s case was against Ian\u2014the jailhouse informants, the VW, the mysterious DNA. Lawson joined the full-time faculty at the University of Hawaii law school, and often took students out to the spot where Ireland was found to test out various prosecution theories. Everything about the case seemed so obviously staged. Even Michael Ortiz, who\u2019d said Ian had confessed to the murder, subsequently received a reduced prison sentence. But how to get the convictions overturned? Ken Lawson at the Hawaii Innocence Project offices Lawson approached the prosecuting attorney on the Big Island, Mitch Roth, and laid out the problems he\u2019d uncovered, proposing a joint reinvestigation of the case. Roth agreed. In 2019, his office gave Lawson\u2019s team access to more than 100 bankers boxes of files and all of the physical evidence. Although the Innocence Project is famous for DNA-based exonerations , this case was unusual: Here, the jury had known that Ian\u2019s DNA was not a match for the blood or semen from the crime scene and had convicted him anyway. But the lawyers had seen this in a few other cases, the most famous being the Central Park Five . The thing to do was to apply as much new technology to the evidence as possible. That would require a new round of DNA testing. \u201cThey only were looking at nine locations on the DNA\u201d in the late 1990s, says Susan Friedman, a lawyer with the New York office of the Innocence Project who, along with one of the group\u2019s founders, Barry Scheck, served as co-counsel on the case. \u201cToday, we look at between 20 and 24.\u201d Read: How the \u2018Central Park Five\u2019 changed the history of American law The team reanalyzed everything, including all semen found on the victim and a man\u2019s T-shirt that had been covered in Ireland\u2019s blood. The new testing dispensed with the \u201cmasked\u201d DNA theory, confirming that the only DNA present was Ireland\u2019s and that of Unknown Male No. 1. Bite-mark evidence also fell away when a new expert essentially dismissed prior analyses as junk science, concluding that the mark on Ireland\u2019s body was made not by a human but probably by an object instead. One more domino was left to fall. In late 2022, lawyers from the Innocence Project and the prosecutor\u2019s office met in a videoconference to discuss the case. There they learned from Keith Shigetomi, who had represented Shawn during the prosecution, that something strange had happened when Shawn had entered his guilty plea in 2000. In order for the judge to accept the plea, Shawn had had to answer questions about his participation in the assault during a polygraph test. Shigetomi now told the assembled group that, in confessing to the crime, Shawn had actually failed that polygraph. Faced with this hurdle, Shigetomi said, he asked the polygraph specialist if he would designate his report as \u201cinconclusive,\u201d which would be just good enough to allow for the guilty plea. (\u201cTo this day, nobody can find that report,\u201d Shigetomi told me. He\u2019s not sure whether a report was ever formally submitted.) And in court, the prosecutor, Lincoln Ashida, told the judge that Shawn had passed the polygraph\u2014which in hindsight clearly seems deceptive. When this all came out in 2022, Shigetomi told me, the prosecutors were dumbfounded. \u201cTheir whole support of the case was based upon Shawn\u2019s statement,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody knew.\u201d On January 24, 2023, after a more than seven-hour-long hearing, Third Circuit Court Judge Peter Kubota ruled that Ian\u2019s lawyers\u2019 new evidence \u201cconclusively proves that in a new trial, a jury would likely reach a new verdict of acquittal.\u201d Ian was a free man. His family surrounded him with hugs. Before the media, Ian was emotional, but also indignant. \u201cI feel like they murdered 25 years of my life,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like they kidnapped me away from my family.\u201d Ashida, who has since moved on from the prosecutor\u2019s office into private practice, declined to comment for this story, explaining that speaking with the press is prohibited by his professional code of conduct. A spokesperson for the prosecutor\u2019s office said, \u201cThere is no evidence to substantiate allegations against any of the prosecutors or investigators who worked on these cases,\u201d and assured me that the office continues \u201cto re-investigate the kidnapping, rape, and murder of Dana Ireland.\u201d They still hope to find Unknown Male No. 1, whose DNA has not turned up any hits in CODIS, the genetic database that law enforcement uses in many rape and murder cases. \u201cThere\u2019s still frustration we don\u2019t know whose DNA it is,\u201d Mitch Roth, the prosecutor who\u2019d agreed to reopen the case and who is now mayor of the Big Island, told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser . Left: Posters calling for the Schweitzer brothers\u2019 death were put up all over Hilo around the time of the trial. Right: A Hawaiian flag hanging at Shawn\u2019s house Who killed Dana Ireland? Ken Lawson told me that most of the women and girls who are abducted on the island are native Hawaiians . Plenty of those cases have gone unsolved, and yet none have generated the same coverage as the Ireland murder. But her case seems, in one respect, not so different from the others. Whoever attacked Ireland, Lawson pointed out, made an effort to transport her from the site of the assault toward the shore. \u201cI think whoever was driving that far with her body was taking her to the ocean,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to get rid of a body in the ocean.\u201d Maybe, he said, when they got there, they saw somebody fishing. So they dumped her \u201cand took off.\u201d Susan Friedman of the Innocence Project believes that the killer might not have shown up in the database for a few reasons. \u201cOne of two things could have happened,\u201d she told me. \u201cEither the person died, and so never went on to potentially commit another crime, or the person never committed another crime.\u201d Dana Ireland\u2019s parents are dead, and no one else in the family has commented on Ian Schweitzer\u2019s exoneration. If the killer is still out there, no one is writing letters to the editor anymore to demand the police track him down. Overnight, Ian went from being a local kid swept up in a once-in-a-generation murder case to being a Central Park Five\u2013level exoneration star. He has traveled to the mainland for celebrations and galas in honor of exonerees. Everyone expects that the civil suit his lawyers are prepping will make him rich. But any settlement, if it happens at all, might take years. Until then, working, dating, and the other everyday aspects of a normal life all seem far out of reach to him. \u201cThis morning I lost my contacts,\u201d he told me, laughing about his confounding new iPhone. Everywhere he goes, there are the hugs of strangers, and John Gonsalves\u2019s truck at the stoplight. \u201cP ersonally, I\u2019m tired of explaining myself, because they keep twisting it around,\u201d John Gonsalves told me. \u201cI\u2019ve got to be careful, too, because I don\u2019t want nothing to come back to me.\u201d I called him the second I left the Schweitzers\u2019 place, expecting to leave a voicemail. When he picked up, we both were a little surprised. During that call, Gonsalves spoke more or less unprompted for several minutes, his voice growing more stressed and defiant\u2014and, it struck me, a little fearful. Since Ian\u2019s exoneration, many people in the area have been looking at Gonsalves the same way they once looked at the Schweitzers: suspiciously. Gonsalves is furious about this. \u201cThis whole thing is a sham. It\u2019s ridiculous. Ridiculous. And then I get threats! People threatening to kill me, kill my kids? \u2026 Honest to God\u2014I mean, No. 1, if they want to try something to me, I\u2019m game. I don\u2019t care. I\u2019ve always been this way. But I didn\u2019t attack the Schweitzers.\u201d He said he just repeated what Pauline had told him way back then. I said I\u2019d like to learn more. He agreed to meet three days later, at 9 a.m. on a Thursday, at a McDonald\u2019s. He was waiting when I got there. He is in his mid-50s now, a grandfather, tough and solid, with the weathered look of someone who has worked outdoors his entire life. Ian and Shawn have a story they tell themselves about Gonsalves\u2014the informant who chose them for no reason, orchestrated their downfall, made money off it, got his freedom on their backs, and escaped scot-free. But as Gonsalves talked, it became clear that he is operating inside a different narrative. It\u2019s the story of a perpetual victim, caught up in something he never really controlled. Michael Ortiz, the jailhouse informant who testified against Ian, for instance, is the last person Gonsalves ever would consider a friend. Gonsalves may have raised Ortiz\u2019s child, but he despises the man. If Ortiz made up stories about Ian in prison, it had nothing to do with Gonsalves. As for Frank Pauline, Gonsalves now says that whatever his brother told the police about the murder was entirely his own doing. Gonsalves was just the one who kindly encouraged him to come clean. \u201cHe said, \u2018You know, John, I\u2019ve been getting nightmares. I can\u2019t sleep.\u2019 He said, \u2018I just need you to help me. You know, maybe you can call the detective and just tell him that I\u2019m willing to come forward.\u2019 And he started telling me everything and I was just\u2014my head was just spinning.\u201d Gonsalves\u2019s probation, he said, had nothing to do with any deal he may have made with the police. \u201cI never asked for anything,\u201d he said. \u201cThe secret deal was between my brother Frank and the state of Hawaii.\u201d The fact that Gonsalves walked away from the island\u2019s biggest coke-dealing bust, he said, only meant that the case was weak. He told me he never dealt drugs. \u201cYou can\u2019t call me a drug dealer,\u201d he said, \u201cif I wasn\u2019t convicted of it.\u201d The reward money? That, he says, was Pauline\u2019s idea too. \u201cHe told me, \u2018John, you know what, just go get the reward. Because they\u2019re going to have to give it to you\u2014because if not, everybody else is going to take it.\u2019\u201d And what, finally, about the Schweitzer brothers? \u201cIn my heart, I believe they did it,\u201d Gonsalves had told me on the phone when we first spoke. He said he still believed everything his brother had said in that first call from prison in 1993. Now I wanted to know more. Did he believe there was a fourth attacker, as the DNA indicated? \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Gonsalves said. But Pauline never mentioned a fourth man when he accused the Schweitzers. How could Gonsalves have believed everything Pauline said when it seemed so clear now that his brother hadn\u2019t told the truth? \u201cI have no idea,\u201d Gonsalves said. I got the sense that he\u2019d spent 20 years not being contradicted and had no idea how to handle it. He equivocated. \u201cWhen he gets mad, he doesn\u2019t think whether it\u2019s true or not,\u201d he said about Pauline. \u201cWho did it? I\u2019ll never know.\u201d I asked again: Does he still think Ian and Shawn Schweitzer raped and killed Dana Ireland? He took a moment before answering. \u201cIt\u2019s tough,\u201d Gonsalves said. \u201cI mean, I hate to say yeah. And I hate to say no. So I think I\u2019ll just leave that neutral. Because I can say whatever I want. It\u2019s just my opinion. You know, everybody has the right to their opinion.\u201d The shoreline near where Dana Ireland\u2019s body was left I t took 10 months \u2014until this October\u2014for the same judge who\u2019d exonerated Ian to overturn Shawn\u2019s conviction, too. All that time, Ian tried to stick to a routine: workouts at the gym, helping his parents out at home. Just a few weeks before the second exoneration came through, he called me excitedly. He\u2019d run into Gonsalves at the grocery store. \u201cYou know those glass automatic doors?\u201d Ian said. \u201cI met face-to-face with him coming into the store.\u201d He\u2019d seen Gonsalves around town plenty, of course, but always in his truck, or across a parking lot\u2014not up close like this. He was surprised by how different he looked from how he\u2019d imagined: \u201cSmall, little guy. I thought he was a big guy. He\u2019s small. Short .\u201d Did Gonsalves recognize Ian? \u201cOh, yeah,\u201d he said. \u201cHe just fucking froze.\u201d So did Ian. In his fantasies, he\u2019d done any number of things in this moment\u2014acted out, vented his anger. Instead, he only stared. Gonsalves put his head down, Ian said. \u201cHe\u2019s stuttering. He was like, \u2018 Ah-ah-ah-ah \u2014how you, Schweitzer?\u2019\u201d And then he rushed past Ian, out the door. \u201cHe fucking walked away.\u201d Ian could hardly believe it. Twenty-five years of being blamed for murder. Twenty-three years in a federal prison. Decades of imagining a moment like this. And all for what? \u201cHow you, Schweitzer?\u201d \u201cThat was it,\u201d Ian said. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t even look me in the face.\u201d About the Author Robert Kolker Robert Kolker is a journalist and author of Hidden Valley Road and Lost Girls .
