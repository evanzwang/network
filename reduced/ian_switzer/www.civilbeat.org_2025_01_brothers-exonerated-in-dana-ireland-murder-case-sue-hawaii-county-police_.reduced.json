  "main_content": "Albert Ian and Shawn Schweitzer say police framed them for the 1991 rape and murder of a tourist on the Big Island. Two brothers exonerated in the 1991 murder of Dana Ireland on the Big Island are suing Hawai\u02bbi County and members of the Hawai\u02bbi County Police Department, accusing officers of suppressing and fabricating evidence while investigating the case. Albert Ian Schweitzer, 53, and Shawn Schweitzer, 49, whose convictions were overturned in 2023, say police framed them for the rape and murder of Ireland, a 23-year-old woman who was struck by a car, sexually assaulted and left for dead on a Puna fishing trail. The Schweitzers argue that police officials, desperate to make an arrest in the high-profile case, followed unreliable tips and coerced jailhouse informants to provide false statements to implicate the brothers. Albert Ian Schweitzer, left, hugs his mother, Linda, in 2023 moments after a judge ordered him released from prison after being locked up for more than 20 years. The judge\u2019s ruling came immediately after Schweitzer\u2019s attorneys presented new evidence and argued that Schweitzer didn\u2019t commit the crimes he was convicted of. (Marco Garcia/The Innocence Project via AP Images) New DNA analysis in 2023 revealed that a man named Albert Lauro Jr. was the sole source of semen found on Ireland\u2019s body. The Schweitzers accuse police of further mishandling their case by failing to arrest Lauro after bringing him in for questioning in July. Lauro killed himself days after speaking with detectives. The Schweitzers accuse the county of malicious prosecution, conspiracy and infliction of severe emotional distress, among other counts; they are seeking an unspecified amount of damages. This lawsuit is separate from their claim for compensation from the state for the years they spent wrongfully incarcerated. \u201cIan and Shawn\u2019s lives were turned upside-down without any warning,\u201d lawyers for the brothers wrote in a complaint filed late Tuesday. \u201cFor decades, they lived with the stigma and injustice of being branded as rapists and killers \u2014 perpetrators of one of the most notorious crimes in modern Hawai\u02bbi history.\u201d Although the Schweitzers\u2019 convictions were overturned, the charges were dismissed without prejudice, meaning they could be refiled. Prosecutors have not ruled that out. Denise Laitinen, spokesperson for the Hawai\u02bbi County Police Department, said in a statement that the department has not yet been served a copy of the lawsuit, but it plans to fully cooperate with the court and defend itself against the claims. \u201cAs this matter is currently in litigation, we will not be providing any further comments at this time,\u201d she wrote. The Hawai\u02bbi County Mayor\u2019s office and corporation counsel, the county\u2019s legal advisor, did not respond Wednesday to interview requests from Civil Beat. \u2018Botched\u2019 Investigation In 1994, nearly three and a half years after Ireland\u2019s murder, police received a tip from a man named John Gonsalves that said his half-brother, Frank Pauline, witnessed the attack on Ireland, according to the complaint. Gonsalves was facing decades in prison on drug charges and Pauline was in his third month of a 10-year sentence on an unrelated offense. Albert Ian Schweitzer, left, and his brother Shawn Schweitzer are suing the Hawai\u2019i County Police Department over what they say was its failure to properly investigate Dana Ireland\u2019s murder. (Madeleine Valera/Civil Beat/2024) Detectives, who had questioned Pauline a year prior, interviewed him again. During the second round, Pauline gave numerous statements with inconsistent accounts of what had happened to Ireland, the complaint says. Detectives prompted him to change his statements to implicate the Schweitzers, the complaint alleges, and offered him benefits in return, including being able to receive additional phone calls, special visits and preferred housing while in prison. When Pauline told police he and the Schweitzers had hit Ireland with a borrowed truck, detectives \u201cmanipulated\u201d him into saying that the vehicle was actually Albert Ian Schweitzer\u2019s Volkswagen Beetle, according to the complaint, which also accuses police of writing fake police reports to make Pauline\u2019s statements appear legitimate. But Pauline later recanted his statements, so investigators \u201cdoubled down\u201d and sought out other jailhouse informants to provide false statements that implicated the Schweitzer brothers and Pauline. Detectives told one man, Michael Ortiz, to testify that Albert Ian Schweitzer confessed to him while they were being held at the Hawai\u02bbi Community Correctional Center, according to the complaint. Four other jailhouse informants were coerced into making statements that Albert Ian or Shawn Schweitzer confessed to them about having a role in Ireland\u2019s rape and murder, the complaint alleges. \u201cDefendants knowingly manufactured these fabricated statements, and they incentivized these witnesses to adopt the statements by promising to provide the informants with benefits \u2014 including reduced jail time \u2014 in exchange for implicating Ian and Shawn,\u201d the complaint says. Albert Ian was convicted of murder, kidnapping and sexual assault in February 2000 and Shawn pleaded guilty to manslaughter and kidnapping in May of that year. A judge ordered Albert Ian Schweitzer \u2018s release from prison in January 2023. Shawn Schweitzer\u2019s conviction was overturned in October of that year. He said he had given a false confession to police to get a plea deal and avoid prison time. Pauline was also later convicted of murder, rape and kidnapping in the Ireland killing, but he was killed in a New Mexico prison in 2015 before he could be exonerated. Continued \u2018Failures\u2019 By Police The Schweitzers\u2019 convictions were overturned thanks to DNA analysis proving that a bloody T-shirt found at the scene of Ireland\u2019s attack did not belong to either of the brothers or Pauline. The source of that DNA, as well as the semen found on Ireland\u2019s body, was still unknown until a private investigation and software company hired by the Hawai\u02bbi Innocence Project identified the man in February 2024 as Albert Lauro. But even after matching Lauro\u2019s DNA using a sample from a discarded fork, police did not arrest him. Hawai\u02bbi island police Chief Ben Moszkowicz said at the time that police lacked probable cause to arrest Lauro for Ireland\u2019s murder. County prosecutors have continued to say that despite the new evidence, they believe the Schweitzer brothers still could have been involved in Ireland\u2019s murder. The police department has also refused to give the Schweitzers\u2019 lawyers documents and records detailing its investigation into Lauro. Albert Lauro Jr., right, was identified last year as the source of semen and other DNA found on Dana Ireland\u2019s body in 1991, but Hawai\u02bbi island police Chief Ben Moszkowicz said the agency lacked probable cause to arrest Lauro for her murder. He killed himself in July. (Hawai\u02bbi Police Department) \u201cRather than conducting an honest investigation \u2014 and closing the case \u2014 (police) continue to spin outrageous theories premised on the false notion that (the Schweitzers) were somehow involved when no reasonable person would believe they are,\u201d the complaint says. One of the Schweitzers\u2019 attorneys, David Owens, of the Chicago-based law firm Loevy and Loevy, said in a written statement that investigators failed his clients and everyone involved in the case by not conducting a fair and thorough investigation. \u201cThey failed the people of Hawai\u02bbi, by letting a killer and rapist go free for 33 years,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThey failed Dana Ireland and her family, by denying them justice, and by failing to apprehend the real killer, who has now ended his life. These failures were egregious and tragic.\u201d During his 25 years in prison, Albert Ian Schweitzer missed out on the lives of his friends and family members, and he was released into a world that had completely changed, the complaint says. In an interview in November at the University of Hawai\u02bbi M\u0101noa, Shawn Schweitzer said he remembers when photos of himself and his brother were plastered across hundreds of newspaper front pages across the county. Even with the new information exonerating them, he said it\u2019s been a struggle to restore their reputation. Albert Ian Schweitzer said in November he\u2019s grateful every day to be free, but he\u2019s still frustrated that he lost so much time. He\u2019s even more frustrated by the fact that it\u2019s been so hard to get compensation from the state. \u201cThe state and county give me nothing, absolutely nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what it is. I didn\u2019t even get a sorry yet.\u201d Page 1 of Schweitzer-Brothers-Complaint-1 Contributed to DocumentCloud by Civil Beat (Civil Beat) \u2022 View document or read text Sign up for our FREE morning newsletter and face each day more informed.
