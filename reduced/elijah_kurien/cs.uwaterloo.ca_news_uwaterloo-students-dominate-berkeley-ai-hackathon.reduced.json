  "main_content": "UWaterloo students dominate Berkeley AI Hackathon Friday, August 23, 2024 A team of undergraduate Computer Science students placed in the top eight at a recent AI Hackathon with \u201cSkyline,\u201d a project that uses demographic data and machine learning to simulate cities and use these patterns to optimize its transit infrastructure. The four students \u2013 Rajan Agarwal (Software Engineering), Elijah Kurien (Software Engineering), Ishaan Dey (Software Engineering) and Joshua Yan (Computer Science) \u2013 were able to attend the hackathon, which took place from June 22 to 24 at the University of California \u2013 Berkeley, thanks to sponsorship from the Math Endowment Fund. \u201cWe had two goals,\u201d Agarwal says: \u201cto represent Waterloo on an international stage, and to learn more about the connections between machine learning, math and calculus.\u201d The friends, who are currently doing co-op terms with tech companies in Berkeley, San Francisco, Palo Alto, and Toronto, are united by their passion for AI, and their desire to use the technology responsibly to make people\u2019s lives better.
