The four students \u2013 Rajan Agarwal (Software Engineering), Elijah Kurien (Software Engineering), Ishaan Dey (Software Engineering) and Joshua Yan (Computer Science) \u2013 were able to attend the hackathon, which took place from June 22 to 24 at the University of California \u2013 Berkeley, thanks to sponsorship from the Math Endowment Fund. \u201cWe had two goals,\u201d Agarwal says: \u201cto represent Waterloo on an international stage, and to learn more about the connections between machine learning, math and calculus.\u201d Read the full story from Waterloo News to learn more.",
