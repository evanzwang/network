Teo enjoys rock climbing, playing the clarinet with the MIT Wind Ensemble, and cooking. In the free time they definitely don't have, they enjoy playing long, complicated board games. Zifan Wang I'm an innocent frosh possibly majoring in pure math. I like metabolizing, destabilizing, photosynthesizing, immaterializing and splenectomizing in my free time. I also play the guitar and consume various kinds of media. For work-related inquiries, contact me at atticusw at mit dot edu. Tobi Hendon Tobi is a Toby but a Tobi spelled with an I, and not a y, which is very important because she refers to herself as I, even though she constantly asks herself why. Tobi enjoys sriracha, specifically when it is on food, but she isn't a very fussy person. In fact, Tobi is a very quiet loud person, just as she is also a very tall short person, a very smart dumb person, and a very alive dead person, with emphasis on the alive part, because... optimism :) Lowell Torola Lowell is a freshman from Upper Michigan currently planning on majoring in 6-3 here at MIT. He enjoys talking about the Midwest to anyone, regardless of whether they want to hear about how much snow his hometown gets (>350 inches!) or how he grew up on a farm. He likes to refer to himself as the 'Number One Sellout' but does actually enjoy programming. In his free time, Lowell enjoys mountain biking, golfing, reading, and fighting boredom at all costs. Kailyn Gustafson Kailyn is a freshman from small-town southeastern Minnesota. She is one of the birthday chairs even if she is not the best at baking (a work in progress). She enjoys inflicting pain upon herself by running, lifting, and attending MIT.
