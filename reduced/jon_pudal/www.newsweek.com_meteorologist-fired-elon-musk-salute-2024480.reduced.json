Share Copy Link \u2713 Link copied to clipboard! A petition calling for a Milwaukee meteorologist to be reinstated at her job after she was reportedly fired for criticizing Elon Musk on social media has gathered over 40,000 signatures. Last week, meteorologist Sam Kuffel was let go from her position at CBS-affiliated WDJT-TV. Her exit came after she posted on a private social media account about Musk's recent straight-arm gesture that many have said looked like a Nazi salute . The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported a spokesperson for Weigel Broadcasting Co., which owns WDJT-TV, confirmed Kuffel was no longer at the station but did not give more details. Newsweek contacted WDJT-TV via online form on Friday for comment and sent a direct message to Kuffel via social media. The press email for Musk's platform X (formerly Twitter ) was also contacted. Why It Matters Musk was accused of making a Nazi salute during President Donald Trump 's inauguration on January 20. The Tesla CEO responded to the allegations on X. \"Frankly, they need better dirty tricks,\" Musk wrote. \"The 'everyone is Hitler' attack is sooo tired.\" Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk gestures as he speaks during the inaugural parade inside Capitol One Arena, in Washington, DC, on January 20, 2025.

Her departure followed two posts on her personal Instagram account about Musk's gesture at Trump's inauguration. In one post, as described by the Journal Sentinel , Kuffel reportedly shared a picture of Musk at the podium, saying: \"Dude Nazi saluted twice. TWICE. During the inauguration.\" She added, \"You f*** with this and this man, I don't f*** with you. Full stop.\" Kuffel also reportedly posted an anti-Nazi meme taken from the television show It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia which features a character is saying, \"Screw that old b****. He's a Nazi.\" Kuffel's Instagram account has since been set to private. Petition For Kuffel After news spread that Kuffel was no longer at the station, a MoveOn petition was started that calls on WDJT-TV to give Kuffel her job back. The petition has collected over 41,000 signatures as of press time. \"It should go without saying that individuals should NOT be punished for speaking out against Nazis or even simply expressing opposition to billionaires on their private social media accounts,\" the petition reads. What People Are Saying The Anti-Defamation League, on X, posted: \"It seems that @elonmusk made an awkward gesture in a moment of enthusiasm, not a Nazi salute, but again, we appreciate that people are on edge.\" Elon Musk wrote on X: in response to critics: \"Frankly, they need better dirty tricks. The 'everyone is Hitler' attack is sooo tired.\" What Happens Next Kuffel, who listed 2019 as her start date at WDJT-TV on LinkedIn, has not publicly commented. The MoveOn petition states its goal is to collect 45,000 signatures. fairness meter fairness meter Newsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.
