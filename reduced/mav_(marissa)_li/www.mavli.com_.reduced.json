Members are required to abide by the Code of Ethics and follow the Guidelines for Professional Conduct as a condition of membership in the organization.\" - CASLI Code of Ethics and Guidelines for Professional Conduct We recognize that the Manitoba Association of Visual Language Interpreters is located on Treaty 1 Territory and our members are active on the Territories of Treaty 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5; the original lands of the Anishinaabe, Cree, Oji-Cree, Dakota and Dene peoples, and the homeland of the Metis Nation. We honour the history and knowledge of the original keepers of this land. We acknowledge the harms caused by colonization and recognize that this harm has influenced our practices as a profession. In our focus on working with members of a marginalized community, the Deaf and Hard of Hearing, we have often neglected the unique experiences of Indigenous peoples. We are dedicated to a spirit of reconciliation and partnership; we commit to learning and growth. We thank those who have taken the time to teach us.
