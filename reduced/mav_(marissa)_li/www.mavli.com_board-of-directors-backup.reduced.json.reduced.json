Since then, I have had the chance to serve as a newsletter chair, and secretary. I now currently occupy the position of President on the MAVLI Board as having volunteered for several national committees. I have a passion for interpreting in medical, post-secondary, and performing arts settings, but aside from that I find mentoring students to be some of the most rewarding work. People keep asking me what I do in my \u201cspare time\u201d; between work, volunteering and having a family with two children under the age of 5, I\u2019ve forgotten what that means. Meaghan Gessner / V ice President / 2016 - 2022 I have been an interpreter for 14 years, graduating from the 4 year ASL-English Interpretation Program through Red River College and the University of Manitoba. I have been in my current position on the board since 2016, but I have also served as the secretary shortly after my graduation. I currently work as the Educational Interpreting Consultant for Manitoba Education but I also do other contract interpreting, primarily in the religious setting (when I have time). I have been married for 12 years and we have four kids, ages 9, 7, 5 and 2, so I don\u2019t have a lot of extra time! \u200b I am looking forward to being a part of this new board for the next couple of years. I think we have board members with a variety of different backgrounds and skills. I am excited to see how this board can better improve MAVLI. Monica Furer / Treasurer / 2017 - 2021 My position is that of Treasurer. I started in 2017 and my second term will end in 2021. Sarah Szalai / Secretary / 2016 - 2022 \u200b My name is Sarah Szalai and I am enjoying contributing to the MAVLI board in the Secretary position. I have been on the board since 2016, first spending two terms as co-chair in the PR portfolio and also as Acting Secretary for one year. My goal while in this portfolio is to execute my duties efficiently and timely, maintaining clear communication between the MAVLI board and MAVLI membership. Since graduating from the AEIP in 2017 I have primarily been working in the Video Relay Service setting and I enjoy the challenge that each day brings. Emma Drury /Membership / 2020 - 2022 Hi there! I have been an interpreter for four years now and I am loving learning new things and meeting new people all the time. The life of an interpreter is never boring and that's what I love about it! I am married and have two children. I was born and raised here in Winnipeg and I love our city. This is my first term on the MAVLI board. Emily Duncan / Fundraising / 2017 - 2021 I have been an interpreter for two years. I work primarily in VRS with some community work. I sit on the board with an aim use generosity and giving as a means to unite members and further MAVLI\u2019s mission. My goal while on the board is to help generate a fund that MAVLI and the membership can use to host workshops, commune together, and thrive. Sheryl LaVallee / Professional Development / 2020 - 2022 I am entering into my 17th year of interpreting and I graduated from the first 4 year ASL-English Interpretation Program offered at Red River College. I currently work in post-secondary full time, but I also work part-time doing some VRS work, as well as community and other contract interpreting. I have been married for 17 years and have two daughters ages 15 and 11. I am really excited to be on the board and work with my talented co-chair and colleague Dawn Marie to bring some really exciting professional development opportunities to our members. Dawn Marie and I were fortunate enough to attend Amber Galloway's music interpreting workshop in the summer of 2019 in Regina and we want to be able to provide the same amazing PD opportunities here in Winnipeg. I am passionate about our profession and I love talking about the work we do while learning from the amazing interpreters we have in our province. When I am not interpreting I love playing and coaching volleyball, doing jigsaw puzzles, and I have a passion for cooking. I am looking forward to being a part of this amazing board for the next two years! \u200b Dawn-Marie Wilson / Professional Development / 2020 - 2022 I\u2019ve been an interpreter for 14 years and I still love it! Of those 14 years, I have previously been on the board in the positions of PR and President, I was also involved in the AVLIC conference planning committee. It\u2019s been a few years, so I\u2019m glad to be back with the board co-chairing with my friend and colleague Sheryl LaVallee. I\u2019m married with two little girls, a three year old and 6 month old who keep me on my toes! Balancing work, family and other personal and professional endeavours will be a challenge, but I\u2019m ready for it! Looking forward to a great year ahead with lots of learning and growth for all of us. Jordan Wynychuk / Public Relations / 2020 - 2022 I have been an interpreter for three years now, primarily working at Sorenson Communications. I really enjoy interpreting and all the wonderful people I have met in the community throughout my years in the program, and afterwards in my career. I am thankful for the many wonderful opportunities. \u200b I have two young girls named Quinn and Scarlett. They are my greatest gifts. I love being their mom. My life is pretty busy with them, but if I do get a spare minute, I enjoy yoga, reading (non-fiction), and I am always interested in learning something new. Shelby Graham / Public Relations / 2020 - 2022 Hey there! My name is Shelby and I\u2019ve been interpreting for just a little over a year. I graduated from the AEIP in 2019. I have a seven year old daughter and she is my entire world. I work primarily in VRS at Sorenson Communications with a little bit of freelancing work here and there. I love interpreting - there\u2019s never a dull moment and I\u2019m always learning something new! This is my first time being on the board and I\u2019m very excited! Work and parenting take up most of my time but I also enjoy shopping, going out to eat, games nights with my friends, stand-up comedy, and napping. \u200b My goal while working on the board with my beautiful co-chair is to revamp the mentoring program for the students, as well as gain the experience of being part of a board. Tessa Rogowski / Member at Large / 2020 - 2022 Hello my name is Tessa Rogowski. I have been an ASL-English Interpreter for over 25 years in the Winnipeg Deaf community. I graduated from the two-year Interpreter Training Program at RRC in 1994. I have worked in Winnipeg during this time, with the exception for two years; I worked one year in Ontario and I travelled Australia for one year. I have worked in a variety of settings: K-12, community and post-secondary. For the past 8 years I have been the Coordinator of Deaf and Hard of Hearing Services at the University of Winnipeg. I love to interpret EVERYTHING! But, I most enjoy post-secondary and theatre. I love to play music, especially the ukulele. You can sometimes catch me busking at The Forks! Heather Hutchinson-Campbell & Joyce Sztandera / MAVLI Education Committee / 2020 - 2022 In the fall of 2019 we were asked to come on board as co-chairs in the MEC position with Meaghan Gessner. We have worked in the K-12 setting for 15 and 20 years respectively. Since 2006 we have faithfully attended MAVLI SAGE PD days. We have seen a variety of topics presented as well as actively participated in discussions surrounding the problems as well as the successes that happen in the classroom. \u200bOur goal as co-chair members is to use our experiences to help streamline topics that are most beneficial to Signing EA\u2019s/Interpreters working in the mainstreamed setting. We are looking forward to working with the new board members. Anna Salgado / Webmaster / 2019 - 2021 I graduated from the interpreting program in Toronto at George Brown College. I returned to Winnipeg and have been working in the field since 2018. I now work full-time at Manitoba School for the Deaf and do VRS and contract work on the side. My hobbies include photography, video producing, bike-riding, and spending time with friends and family. I have an awesome husband named Joey and two very cute cats, Rorie and Floyd! I am very lucky to be a CODA with two Deaf parents and a Deaf brother. My long-term career goal is to increase awareness and access to accessible forms of communication and help increase representation of BIPOC folks in the interpreting field.
