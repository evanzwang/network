Mobile and ubiquitous computing : ubiquitous and wireless sensing systems for healthcare, mobile interaction, etc. Research Methodology: System implementation : on software radios (WARP/USRP), Android, Linux network drivers, and customized hardware platforms. Theoretical modeling : Signal processing, computational imaging, machine learning, convex optimization, probability models. News: Looking for postdoc, research engineer and visiting scholars with experiences in communication hardware and machine learning models. See details here . I am looking for self-motivated students to work on research projects in wireless networking and mobile computing. Read my \"Notes to Prospective Students\" if you are interested in joining our research group. 06/2024.
