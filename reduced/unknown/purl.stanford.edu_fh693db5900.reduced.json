  "main_content": "Learning from unknown information sources Placeholder Show Content Show Content Abstract/Contents Abstract When an agent receives information generated by a source whose accuracy might either be high or low, standard economic theory dictates that she update as if the source has medium accuracy. In a lab experiment, I find that subjects' updating behaviors deviate from this benchmark. First, subjects under-react to information when the source is uncertain. Second, the under-reaction is more pronounced for good news than for bad news. These two patterns, under-reaction and pessimism, are consistent with a theory of belief updating where agents are insensitive and averse to compound uncertainty and ambiguity. I also find that subjects' reactions to information with uncertain accuracy are uncorrelated with their evaluations of bets with uncertain odds. This suggests that people have distinct attitudes toward uncertainty in information accuracy and uncertainty in economic fundamentals. The experimental results are validated using observational data on stock price reactions to analyst earnings forecasts, where analysts with no forecast records are classified as uncertain information sources Description Type of resource text Form electronic resource; remote; computer; online resource Extent 1 online resource Place California Place [Stanford, California] Publisher [Stanford University] Copyright date 2020; \u00a92020 Publication date 2020; 2020 Issuance monographic Language English Creators/Contributors Author Liang, Yucheng Degree supervisor Ostrovsky, Michael Thesis advisor Ostrovsky, Michael Thesis advisor Bernheim, B.
