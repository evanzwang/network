  "main_content": "By Gregory Wakeman Special to The Seattle Times When Matthew Law joined \u201cAbbott Elementary,\u201d it was literally a dream come true. The actor and filmmaker, who was born in Yakima and raised in Seattle, calls the sitcom about a group of Philadelphia teachers trying to educate their students a \u201cgenerationally great show,\u201d adding, \u201cI genuinely think it\u2019s one of the best shows ever made. I\u2019m in love with it.\u201d So when Law was cast in the recurring role of O\u2019Shon, the school district\u2019s new IT representative who catches the eye of principal Ava Coleman (Janelle James), he was immediately excited \u2014 and a little intimidated. Related \u2018Abbott Elementary\u2019 earns Golden Globe nomination \u201cIt was intimidating because I didn\u2019t want to mess it up,\u201d Law says over the phone. \u201cI think what (series creator and star) Quinta Brunson and the rest of the cast and crew have created is a show that\u2019s joyful and truthful.\u201d Law didn\u2019t just want to excel on \u201cAbbott Elementary\u201d because it\u2019s one of the most beloved and popular sitcoms on television. He put extra pressure on himself because he studied at Temple University, and his time in Philadelphia shaped who he is. At the same time, the public schools he attended in Seattle are where he first fell in love with movies. \u201cI attended Greenwood Elementary, Whitman Middle, then Ballard High. \u2026 I had teachers who introduced me to Hitchcock in middle school.\u201d Advertising Law and his friends would hang around people who were into film, which then sparked his fascination with editing and cinematography, the latter of which he studied at Temple. It was only after he completed his studies that Law first started performing. While he\u2019d always been interested in it, as someone who wanted to write, direct, edit, produce and photograph, he thought adding another string to his bow would be excessive. But the urge never went away. \u201cI always had that desire. But I think it was easier for me to hide in production. Acting called for me to be vulnerable in a way that I wasn\u2019t ready for.\u201d When Law arrived in Los Angeles, he finally decided to take the plunge and attend acting classes. As he learned more about the craft and training, he started to feel \u201ca little whisper of intuition\u201d that told him acting was really part of his purpose. Law was clearly right to follow his instincts: Over the past few years, he\u2019s appeared in episodes of \u201cHome Economics,\u201d \u201cNCIS: Los Angeles\u201d and the Star Wars series \u201cAhsoka,\u201d as well as the music video for Jennifer Lopez\u2019s \u201cCan\u2019t Get Enough,\u201d and had a recurring role in all five seasons of Tyler Perry\u2019s political drama \u201cThe Oval.\u201d Related What to stream in December: \u2018Star Wars: Skeleton Crew,\u2019 \u2018Squid Game\u2019 Law has also been hard at work behind the camera. He\u2019s written and directed five short films for his \u201cTrue Story\u201d series, which he describes as noir therapy drama. Each film follows a character struggling with their mental health and trying to find guidance from a therapist and/or their friends. \u201cTrue Story: God Tells Bad Jokes\u201d won the award for best short narrative at the 2023 Pan African Film & Arts Festival, which qualified it for the Academy Awards. At the end of 2023, Law held the multimedia event \u201cTrue: An Immersive Cinematic Experience\u201d in Los Angeles, which saw the short films incorporated into a play with live music. It sold out all five shows and more than 2,000 people attended. Law already has ambitions to take it to New York and Seattle for similar events.

Not only is he appearing in \u201cAbbott Elementary,\u201d but Law can be seen in the second season of \u201cBased on a True Story.\u201d All eight episodes of the dark comedy thriller, which stars Kaley Cuoco and Chris Messina as a couple obsessed with true crime, are available on Peacock. As a fan of both Cuoco and Messina\u2019s work, Law was again a little nervous when he arrived on set to portray the character of Nick. But, much like his time on \u201cAbbot Elementary,\u201d he was quickly blown away by how \u201cfun and collaborative\u201d the experience was. \u201cThere\u2019s a real spirit of collaboration on both of these shows. But you\u2019re also very aware of the creative vision that they\u2019re trying to achieve. On both of the shows, everyone involved \u2014 from the PAs to the writers and directors \u2014 they\u2019re all so invested. That\u2019s so invigorating to see. These are two shows that are being run right. You can see that on screen, too.\u201d But while Law is hopeful he\u2019ll get to return in further episodes of \u201cAbbott Elementary,\u201d and is hard at work making sure \u201cTrue Story\u201d is seen by people across the country, he\u2019s hoping this is just the start of his creative endeavors. Law\u2019s ambition is always to just \u201cgrow and deepen as an artist,\u201d whether it\u2019s acting, directing, producing or writing, and to tell new stories. \u201cHopefully, one day soon, I can come back to Seattle and Yakima and give people that chance. I just want to give people the chance to share their stories. Because there are so many that haven\u2019t been seen or heard before.\u201d \u201cAbbott Elementary\u201d The first eight episodes of Season 4 are streaming on Hulu.
