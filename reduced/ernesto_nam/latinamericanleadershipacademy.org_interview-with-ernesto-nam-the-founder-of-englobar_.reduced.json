  "main_content": "\u201cI saw my father cry, and it was the first time I saw him cry, and then we lost our house and had to move suddenly, and then a few months later, I was rejected from every college I applied to, all in a really short period of time.\u201d But Ernesto Nam turned these difficult months into something beautiful, maximizing his sabbatical to work on causes he was passionate about while prioritizing personal growth and understanding. During his family\u2019s economic crisis, Ernesto was already working with a \u201cHabit for Humanity\u201d type foundation called TECHO, which ended up being a tremendous source of inspiration for him. \u201cWhile all this was going on, I had the opportunity to be the leader of a build with TECHO, which was a 10-week process,\u201d Ernesto said. \u201cI was the first teenager to lead a build primarily of college students.\u201d He began spending 20 to 30 hours a week helping to organize a five-day build to build housing for vulnerable communities, which was the largest build of the year. It re-oriented Ernesto\u2019s perspective and gave him a great source of happiness. \u201cI was helping people who had practically nothing, and they were happy because they were going to have a house,\u201d Ernesto said, \u201cand I was sad because I had almost everything but a house for a short period of time.\u201d All of this combined to push Ernesto to start a nonprofit during his gap year because he didn\u2019t want to rely solely on TECHO to be able to impact people\u2019s lives. So, he started Englobar as his passion project for social impact and also started tutoring people in his community to help his parents financially as much as he could because he was also an Olympic math champion. Englobar aims to address several prevalent social problems while motivating volunteers to contribute positively to society. \u201cStarting in Paraguay and Latin America, we see that besides having a bad educational system, a bad social system, and a lot of corruption, there is a bigger problem of widespread hopelessness,\u201d Ernesto said. He insisted on hopelessness as the biggest problem because it leads to people contributing less to their communities, and that is exactly what his organization aims to combat through education. While they focused on teaching the underprivileged, Ernesto didn\u2019t stop there, noting the potential for privileged people to help their communities as well if they knew how. So, while they teach basic reading and math to their students so they can pursue what their interests really are, they also conduct leadership and environmental education activities. Hence, their students have a solid foundation and the ability to effect even small changes. Englobar is currently in Paraguay and Mexico with over 250 volunteers. Ernesto was not only able to turn an unfortunate situation into a positive one but also reshaped his thought process about the future and what is important to him as well. After applying to only the best American universities, he now realizes that the name of the school is not what matters but what he can do with his education. His maturity and experience now radiate from him. \u201cFrom my high school experience for TECHO, I found my passion for helping those less fortunate,\u201d Ernesto said, \u201cand then with my family situation, I really found my true north.\u201d Similar Posts Intro When I was selected to participate in LALA\u2019s Leadership Bootcamp, I felt a mixture of ambivalent feelings: extreme happiness for another accomplishment and fear of the new that awaited me. But, as I learned to do with every opportunity, I seized it despite all the insecurity. As a young black woman from Brazil\u2019s northeast,\u2026 Jo\u00e3o\u2019s routine hasn\u2019t changed since he was accepted into Haverford College with a full-ride scholarship to study political science and education for the next four years.

But I actually want to talk about it because people need to\u2026",
