We are a group of students from Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology who are interested in machine learning. In our beginner series, we provide fun and engaging lectures and competitions that introduce machine learning concepts. In our advanced series, we supplement and go beyond the content taught in the TJ ML Class. What We Do TJHSST Machine Learning Club aims to bring the complex and vast topic of machine learning to high school students. We teach a variety of topics, including SVMs, Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, and more. Competitions and Challenges We hold challenges every week to supplement the topics we cover in the lectures. Every so often, we have larger competitions, where everyone competes to produce the best solution to solve real world challenges using actual data. TJHSST Machine Learning also strongly encourages students to take part in external competitions to improve their knowledge.
