I was an MSR student at Carnegie Mellon University, where I am grateful to have worked with Shubham Tulsiani . I was also fortunate to work with David Fouhey during my undergrad at the University of Michigan. I am thankful to receive funding from NSF GRFP.

Jan 2021 - Won ProjectX ML research competition focused on climate change, advised by Sindhu Kutty. Mar 2020 - [ Article ] Michigan Alexa Prize team entered semi-finals. Research I am interested in understanding and generating 3D scenes from casual videos, images, and text. MVD-Fusion: Single-view 3D via Depth-consistent Multi-view Generation Hanzhe Hu*, Zhizhuo Zhou* , Varun Jampani, Shubham Tulsiani *Equal contribution CVPR 2024 We propose a novel depth-aware 3D attention mechanism for generating multi-view consistent RGB-D images given a single RGB image. SparseFusion: Distilling View-conditioned Diffusion for 3D Reconstruction Zhizhuo Zhou , Shubham Tulsiani CVPR 2023 We propose a 3D neural mode-seeking formulation that combines probabilistic generation of unseen regions with faithful reprojection of seen regions in a consistent 3D representation. Quantifying Bird Skeletons Zhizhuo Zhou , Gemmechu Hassena, Brian C. Weeks, David F. Fouhey CV4Animals Workshop in conjunction with CVPR 2021 We can measure bird skeleton specimens extraordinarily accurately and quite fast with deep learning. This system can unlock datasets of birds at unprecedented scales.
